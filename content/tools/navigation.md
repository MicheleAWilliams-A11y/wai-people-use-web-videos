Video script for [Navigation](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/tools-techniques-navigation/) from the page [Tools and Techniques](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/tools-techniques/) (in the [2020 Update](https://github.com/w3c/wai-people-use-web/wiki/Persona-development) version).

## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | When content is designed right, people can navigate and find content using different strategies and approaches depending on their preferences, skills, and abilities. | We see a collage of four people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, many people with cognitive and learning disabilities rely on clear layout and design to find information on websites and apps. This includes different ways of navigating the content, such as hierarchical menus as well as search functionality; visual orientation cues, such as using background colors to indicate different parts of the content, using unique headings, and placing relevant information in prominent areas; and consistency and predictability of within websites and apps. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#2/Ian) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ian's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ian/)).] We see the person (#2/Ian) browsing a website that is well-structured with clear layout and design. We see the person (#2/Ian) using the search function to find a page; that second page has a consistent layout and design as the first, and the person (#2/Ian) is immediately oriented and able to continue reading/interacting. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | While many of these are typically usability aspects that affect people with and without disabilities, these situations often affect people with disabilities to a greater extent. For example, people with low vision who use screen magnification also rely on visual orientation cues to orient themselves and find information on websites and apps. | [New scene; switch to person (#7/Noor) who is featured in a separate video (see [Noor's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/noor/)).] We see the person (#7/Noor) browsing that same website using screen magnification. [Viewers might recognize the visual style and colors of the website even though it is enlarged.] We see the person (#7/Noor) use the heading styles and other cues to know where they are on the page and continue reading/interacting. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | And consistency and predictability helps everyone. For example, people who are blind use screen readers to scan the content structures, such as headings, links, and navigational menus to get an overview and orient themselves. Websites and apps with clear and consistent headings, labels, and structures make the content more predictable and easier to navigate. | [New scene; switch to person (#3/Ilya) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ilya's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/)).] We see the person (#3/Ilya) using a mobile phone. The person (#3/Ilya) is wearing headphones to listen to the audio and gesturing (eg. swiping, flicking, and pinching etc.) on the turned off screen of the mobile phone while on the go. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | In addition, people who are blind rely on mechanisms to skip over blocks of content, such as headings, navigation bars, or menus, repeated within websites and apps. They also rely on websites and apps to provide clear instructions and help users identify and correct mistakes, such as incorrect dates, numbers, and other input. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We scan over the same website shown in scenes 2 and 3; We do not see the person (#3/Ilya), who actually has a turned off screen, but the visuals suggest that what we are seeing is the website that the person (#3/Ilya) is hearing. The particular web page we are seeing has a form with clear instructions (eg. explanation of the format for the date to enter and maybe "i" icons for context-based help) that looks inviting to complete. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | As do people with physical disabilities who are using different types of specialized keyboards and pointing devices -- they also rely on websites and apps that help them identify and correct mistakes, such as accidental typing and clicking. In addition, people with physical disabilities rely on consistent labels on websites and apps, which allow browsers to optionally remember previous entries. This accelerates typing because people can select previous entries, for example names and addresses. | [New scene; switch to person (#1/Alan) who is featured in a separate video (see [Alan's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/)).] We see the person (#1/Alan) completing that same form from the previous scene. We see the person (#1/Alan switching between typing on the keyboard and navigating by joystick. We see the person (#1/Alan) fill in one of the form entries by selecting information that he previous typed (eg. name and/or address), which was saved by the browser. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the four protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each personâ€™s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
