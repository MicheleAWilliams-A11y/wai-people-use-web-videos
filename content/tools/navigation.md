## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People navigate and process content in different ways. When content is designed right, people can browse it effectively according to their preferences, skills, and abilities. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, people who are blind or with low vision might not be seeing the screen. They scan the content structures and headings to get an overview and orient themselves. In turn, content structures such as navigation menus and sidebars need to be properly labeled, and long passages of text need to be broken up with succinct headings that describe the different sections. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1/Ilya) shown in the collage in the previous scene but we focus more on the technology rather than on the person; Ilya will be featured in a separate video too (see [Ilya's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-three/)).] We see person (#1/Ilya) using a screen reader, headphones, and a refreshable braille display. We scan over the content on the screen with navigation menu, sidebar, and main content area with headings as the narration mentions these aspects. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Other people with low vision might be using screen magnification, and only seeing a small part of the screen at a time. They use visual cues to orient themselves. Such visual cues can include background colors for different parts of a web page, distinct visual styles for the different heading levels, and placing buttons consistently in predictable places in the content. |  [New scene; switch to another person (#2) from the initial collage in the first scene; this person (#2) also happens to be person #2 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/), will who likely be featured in the "Visual" video (see [Visual page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-visual/))] We see a person (#2) using screen magnification software, and using visual cues to orient themselves around a web page. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with limited hand movement or control might be using only the keyboard (or keyboard alternatives) to navigate through the content. They need all functionality to be available through the keyboard alone without needing to use a  mouse or touch screen. They also need the focus indicator to be visible and the sequence of switching focus from one area to the next to be logical. | [New scene; switch to person (#3) also happens to be person #3 in the [Perception script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/perception/), and who will likely be featured in the "Cognitive, learning, and neurological" video (see [Cognitive, learning, and neurological page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-cognitive/)).] We see person (#3) using a headstick (possibly with celebral palsy or similar) to tab from one checkbox/radio-button to the next. We clearly see the focus indicator, and the sequence from one checkbox/radio-button to the next is in order. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with limited short-term memory might have difficulty remembering the addresses, names, or particular functionality of websites and apps. Content that is properly programmed and designed helps browers and apps recognize form fields and help users to fill them in; for example, they can provide previously saved addresses and names for users to select from more easily. | [New scene; siwtch to person (#4/Yun) who will be featured in a separate video too (see [Yun's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-nine/)).] We see person (#4/Yun) completing an online form using increased text size. The browser enters a previously save address into the address field, which person (#4/Yun) carefully reviews before moving on to the next field. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People may have difficulty with hierarchical menu navigation, as how most navigation menus are designed to be. Websites and apps need to provide alternative mechanisms for navigation, such as search functionality and site maps, to support different ways for people to navigate through the content. | [New scene; siwtch to person (#5/Luis) who will be featured in a separate video too (see [Luis' story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-five/)).] We see person (#5/Luis) going straight to the search function of a website, rather than the main navigation menu, to find information on the website. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | While many of these are typically usability aspects that affect people with and without disabilities, some situations affect people with disabilities to a greater extent. For example, inconsistent page design might be a nuisance to someone but a complete barrier to someone else. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see person (#5/Luis) on a page of the same website with a completely different visual style and layout. Person (#5/Luis) seems confused and stuck, trying to re-orient themselves to the new design. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each personâ€™s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
