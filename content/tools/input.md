## Summary

* Narrated video (using voice-over to explain)

## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | When content is designed right, people can use different approaches to enter text and activate commands. For instance, some people do not use a mouse, keyboard, or both, while others use specific configurations for keyboard and mouse, or use alternative hardware and software altogether. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, people who are blind use the keyboard only, and cannot use a mouse, touch screen, or other pointing devices. Websites and apps need to allow all functionality to be carried out through the keyboard alone. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1/Ilya) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ilya's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/)).] We see the person (#1/Ilya) sitting in front of a computer and typing on a keyboard, and occassionally reading off the refreshable braille display. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | This also applies to people with physical disabilities. Many are using customized input devices, including specialized keyboards, mouse, and other pointing devices. People often need more time for typing, writing, and clicking on websites and apps. | [New scene; switch to person (#2/Alan) who is featured in a separate video (see [Alan's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/)).] We see the person (#2/Alan) using a specialized keyboard with larger keys and a joystick with bigger buttons and a customized (larger) lever. We see the person (#2/Alan) interacting with the computer and switching between keyboard and joystick. [Viewers might notice that it is taking the person (#2/Alan) more effort to carry out these activities.] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with cognitive and learning disabilities often also need more time for typing, writing, and clicking on websites and apps. Websites and apps also need to provide clear instructions and options to find and correct mistakes in their input, to help people complete forms and processes effectively. | [New scene; switch to person (#3/Luis) who is featured in a separate video (see [Luis' script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/luis/)).] We see the person (#3/Luis) interacting with the computer in a similar setting to the previous (eg. office, at home, on the road, etc.). We see the person (#3/Luis) also focusing and needing more effort while interacting with the computer. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | And websites and apps also need to ensure that the focus indicator of the browser remains visible, and provide ways to skip over content repeated on every page, such as headers and navigation bars. In addition, they also need to make click areas larger for people who have difficulty clicking on small links, buttons, and other controls. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Yun) who is featured in a separate video (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see the person (#4/Yun) typing and clicking more slowly and with some difficulty, and being helped by the distinctive visible focus reminding him of the input field that is currently active. We see the person (#4/Yun) having difficulty clicking on small areas (eg. radio button) due to tremors. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Finally, websites and apps also need to consider people who do not use keyboard or pointing devices at all, and use speech input instead. For example, websites and apps need to be programmed and designed so that the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed to the user. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist speak a command to the computer, like "click send email".] | [New scene; switch to person (#5) who also happens to be person #4 in the [Physical script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/physical/).] We see the person (#5) [with no visible disability] using a headset/microphone to dictate words in an email. We do not hear what the person (#5) is saying at first but we see their mouth moving and words appearing in the email. We see the person (#5) continuing with the "send email" command, and see their mouth move while we hear these words, and we understand that the person was dictating the email all along. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each personâ€™s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
