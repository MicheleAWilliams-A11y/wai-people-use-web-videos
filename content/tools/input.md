## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; input - typing, writing, and clicking. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Input - typing, writing, and clicking". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | When content is accessible, people can use a variety of hardware and software to enter text and activate commands. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people do not use keyboards, and use only pointing devices instead. This could include a specialized mouse, joystick, trackball, or touch screen to click links and buttons and to type on on-screen keyboards. However, even when using such tools, people might have difficulty selecting small targets, such as small links, buttons, and controls. Websites and apps with large click areas around checkboxes, radio buttons, and other controls, are easier to use for people with limited mobility and reduced dexterity. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#15) shown in the collage in the previous scene.] We see the person (#15) using a touch screen mounted to their wheelchair. We see the person (#15) tapping the touchscreen with their knuckles, mouthstick, eye tracking, or similar [the protagonist might have limited control or involuntary movement]. We see the person (#15) is entering data in an app, first reading the instructions that appear (eg. "Please enter your email address") then typing the information (eg. with an on-screen keyboard). [This scene is similar to scene in 5 in the [Physical script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/physical/) with elements of scene 3 with the person (#9/Yun) in the same script.] |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps also need to provide support for people who use the keyboard only. This includes providing ways to skip over repeated content, such as headers and navigation bars, as well as not breaking the default functionality in browsers and operating systems that use the Tab key to move around clickable items in the content, use the Enter key for selecting items, and show a rectangular box known as focus indicator around the currently active item, so that people can see which item is currently active. Websites and apps that provide word prediction and accelerators, for example for search terms, reduce the amount of required typing, and make them more effective for keyboard users. | [New scene.] We see the person (#14) using a headstick (possibly with cerebral palsy or similar) to type on a regular keyboard. We see the person (#14) using the Tab and Enter keys on a form, and the focus indicator move accordingly as the person (#14) navigates to a text box and starts typing (e.g. an email message). We hear the narration at the same time as the visuals. [This scene is similar to scene in 2 in the [Physical script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/physical/).] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Additionally, not everyone using only the keyboard can see the screen; for example, people who are blind. So, in addition to ensuring keyboard support, websites and apps also need to provide clear instructions, labels for form controls, error messages, and status notifications, so that people know what is happening on the screen. | [New scene; switch to person (#3/Ilya) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ilya's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/)).] We see the person (#3/Ilya) using a mobile phone. The person (#3/Ilya) is wearing headphones to listen to the audio and gesturing (eg. swiping, flicking, and pinching etc.) on the turned off screen of the mobile phone while on the go. [This scene is similar to scene in 4 in the [Navigation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/navigation/) and similar to scene 3 in the [Ilya script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/).] |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps also need to help people find and correct mistakes in their input; for example, by showing a summary of the entered data before finalizing a submission. They also need to provide sufficient time to complete tasks, or avoid timing limitations altogether. Many people with disabilities require more time to navigate and orient themselves in the content, and to click and type while coping. In particular, people with cognitive and learning disabilities. | [New scene; switch to person (#5/Luis) who is featured in a separate video (see [Luis' script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/luis/)).] We see the person (#5/Luis) interacting with the computer or mobile phone (eg. office, at home, on the road, etc.). We see the person (#5/Luis) also focusing and needing more effort while interacting with the computer. We realize that the person (#5/Luis) was completing a form and is now seeing the data summary/confirmation page. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Finally, websites and apps also need to consider people who do not use keyboard or pointing devices at all, and use speech input instead. For example, websites and apps need to be programmed and designed so that the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed to the user. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist speak a command to the computer, like "click send email".] | [New scene; switch to person (#1/Alan) who is featured in a separate video (see [Alan's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/)).] We see the person (#1/Alan) dictating words in an email. We do not hear what the person (#1/Alan) is saying at first but we see their mouth moving and words appearing in the email. We see the person (#1/Alan) continuing with the "send email" command, and see their mouth move while we hear these words, and we understand that the person was dictating the email all along. [This scene is similar to scene in 7 in the [Alan script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/) and to scene 4 in the [Physical script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/physical/).] |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] These are ways to make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the five protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. [Note: some protagonists might be signing rather than speaking, or speaking with the help of software or hardware tools.] |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
