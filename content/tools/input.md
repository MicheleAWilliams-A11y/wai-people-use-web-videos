## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People interact with computers in different ways. This includes using different types of hardware and software tools to enhance the efficiency of typing, writing, and clicking. | We see a collage of four people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, some people with certain types of cognitive, neurological, and physical disabilities have limited hand movement or control. Some use specialized keyboards; for example, with larger, softer, or more robust keys that they can press more easily. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1) shown in the collage in the previous scene, and who will likely be featured in the "Physical" video (see [Physical page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-physical/)).] We see person (#1) is using a specially designed/mounted keyboard; for example, it is attached to their bed where they can reach it while lying down. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some use different types of switches; for example, a single button through which they operate the entire computer. Specialized software that is sometimes part of the operating system presents one function, menu item, or letter at a time, which users select through the button to activate the function, menu item, or to type a letter. | [New scene; switch to person (#2) who will also likely be featured in the "Physical" video (see [Physical page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-physical/)).] We see person (#2) is using a single switch, maybe with their foot or elbow. We see the computer screen, and the accelerator software tool that they are using. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some use a headstick or a mouthstick to type on a keyboard. With these tools, people press only one key at a time using the stick they hold in their mouth or that is mounted on a headband. Operating systems often provide "sticky keys" options, so that people using such tools can press button combinations, such as ctrl-alt-F4 in sequence rather than in parallel. | [New scene; switch to person (#3) who will likely be featured in the "Cognitive, learning, and neurological" video (see [Cognitive, learning, and neurological page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-cognitive/)).] We see person (#3) using a headstick (possibly with celebral palsy or similar). We see them typing and entering ctrl-alt-F4 in sequence. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some use pointing devices, such as mouse, joystick, trackball, steering wheel, and touch screen with or instead of keyboards, switches, and speech. Some people use different types of eye-tracking, motion-detection, and brain-computing interfaces as well. Often these are used in combination with on-screen keyboards for typing. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Alan); Alan will be featured in a separate video too (see [Alan's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-one/)).] We see person (#4/Alan) using a larger keyboard and joystick to interact with the computer. We see person (#4/Alan) using the palm of their hands to press the key (as opposed to using their fingers). |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People often use these input tools in combination word prediction software to help complete words and sentences with minimal typing; grammar and spelling tools to help correct text; and tools to help click, select text, and scroll with minimal movement. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We swing over from the physical keyboard and joystick to the computer screen, where we see word prediction tool helping person (#4/Alan) to type more efficiently. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For this to work, websites and apps need to be programmed and designed for keyboard support. For example, so that all functionality, such as selecting a date, can be carried out through the keyboard alone without needing to use a mouse or touch screen. Also, to ensure that the focus indicator is visible and that there are no keyboard traps. A keyboard trap is when users cannot leave part of a web page or app without using a mouse or touch screen. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see person (#4/Alan) stuck on a date picker that does not work by keyboard. Person (#4/Alan) has difficulty navigating the joystick to the small click area provided by the widget. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Many people with limited hand movement or control use speech input, which also uses the keyboard interface in the background. To support speech input, websites and apps need to be programmed and designed with particular considerations in addition to keyboard support. For example, so that the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed to the user. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist speak a command to the computer, like "click purchase".] | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see person (#4/Alan) contiuing to complete the form he was working on, now using speech input rather than keyboard and joystick. The narration stops as he finishes, and we see hear and see the person (#4/Alan) submit the purchase button through speech. |
| 9 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For all users with with limited hand movement or control, websites and apps need to provide sufficient time for typing and completing tasks. They also need to provide clear instructions to help users complete forms and processes, and help users identify and correct mistakes easily. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see person (#4/Alan) being presented with a summary of their purchase order, which they are reviewing for mistakes. |
| 10 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the four protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each personâ€™s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
