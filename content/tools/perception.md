## Summary

* Narrated video (using voice-over to explain)

## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | When content is designed right, people perceive it through different senses depending on their needs and preferences. For example, some people are not seeing the screen or hearing the audio. | We see a collage of four people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, people who are blind or who have low vision often rely on hearing or on touch rather than sight. For video, content authors need to ensure that the visual information is provided in audio too. Often these descriptions of visual information use existing pauses in the audio track, or the audio is created from the start with sufficient description of the scenes, characters, and other visual information in the video. [brief pause to listen to a short slice of audio description while the video is being shown in the visuals] | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1/Ilya) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ilya's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/)).] We see person (#1/Ilya) starting a video and switching on the "Audio Description" feature. We see brief part of the video that Ilya start while we hear the audio descriptions for that scene. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are blind use assistive technology called screen readers. These software tools present information on the screen in audio to hear, or in braille on a refreshable braille display. Braille characters are a combination of raised or lowered dots, which people read by scanning over them with the tip of their fingers. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see person (#1/Ilya) leave the video and continue to read on the text on the page. We focus on the refreshable braille display as the narration explains it. We focus further on the individual braille letters as the narration continues. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For screen readers to work, content needs to be properly programmed and designed. For example, so that screen readers can convey what an image is to a user who cannot see it, each image needs to have a text alternative. Also, headings, tables, lists and other structures need to be properly coded, so that screen readers can identify and indicate these structures to the user. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We swing over from the refreshable braille display to the computer screen. We scan over the content with the images, headings, tables, and lists, appearing as the narration mentions them. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Similarly to people who are blind, people who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing use haptic senses too; for example, through vibrations alerts on the mobile phone instead of auditory notifications. | [New scene; switch to person (#2) who also happens to be person #2 in the [Auditory script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/auditory/).] We see the phone of person (#2) vibrating when a notification appears on the screen. The attention of person #2 is drawn to the phone because of the vibration. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing often rely on seeing instead of hearing; for example, by looking at the captions and sign language as an alternative to the audio. | [New scene; switch to person (#3/Martine) who is featured in a separate video (see [Martine's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/martine/)).] We see person (#3/Martine) in an online meeting with sign language interpreters pinned and with captions turned on. This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Martine script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/martine/). |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people with reading disabilities also convert content into formats they can better understand; for example, to convert text and functionality into symbols. Symbols could be pictures of the words; for example, a picture of an apple instead of the word "apple". They can also be recognizable icons for certain functionality, such as a home icon to symbolize "back to home" functionality, or a cash icon to symbolize "purchase" functionality. | [New scene.] We see person (#4) using adaptation tools to show symbols instead of text. The focus is more on the symbols on the screen appearing in sequence with the narration rather than on the person. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the four protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each personâ€™s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
