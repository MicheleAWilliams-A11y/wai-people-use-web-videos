| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | One of the great things about digital technology -- when it's designed right -- is that it allows users to change the way content is presented. This flexibility is essential for people with many types of disabilities, who might need particular types of presentation to better perceive the content. | @@@ |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, people with visual disabilities might need larger text and images sizes, or higher contrast between text and background colors to see the content better. Most operating systems allow users to adjust their preferred text size. Web browsers, apps, and content should respect these settings. Many web browsers and document readers also provide functionality to "zoom" into the content, which enlarges text and image sizes. Content that is well designed reflows and adjusts to the zooming, to remain readable. Some people need further magnification and use specialized tools for that. These include hardware lenses and other visual aids, as well as software tools and functionality built into the operating system of the computer. Some people use tools that provide other types of adaptation, such as changing the font type, colors, and spacing to make text more readable. | @@@ |
