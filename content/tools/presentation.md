## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:15 | One of the great things about digital technology – when it’s designed right – is that it allows people to change the way content is presented, to make the content easier to distinguish and understand. | We see a collage of six people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:15 - 0:45 | For example, some people with low vision use larger text to make it easier to read. Many operating systems for computers and mobile devices provide settings for larger text but unfortunately not all web browsers and apps follow these settings. Some web browsers have additional settings to adjust how the text on websites is presented but unfortunately not all websites and apps are well designed so that the text size cannot be adjusted. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1/Yun) shown in the collage in the previous scene but we focus more on the technology rather than on the person; Yun will be featured in a separate video too (see [Yun's story page]([url](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-nine/))).] We see person (#1/Yun) using a mobile phone with noticeably larger text size (and icons). He opens an app that he just downloaded and is surprised by how small the text appears. He opens the mobile phone settings and further increases the text size -- all text appears bigger from now on (e.g. the settings screen and other screens as he navigates back) except for the app he was trying to use. He tries to enlarge/zoom using the pinch-out gesture with his fingers on the screen but the app doesn't respond to this gesture either. |
| 3 | 0:45 - 1:40 | Other people with low vision use screen magnification software, which enlarges all content including text and images. Many people who use screen magnification software tend to have a combination of conditions impacting vision; for example, reduced color perception in addition to reduced visual acuity. This is why screen magnification softwares often provide further functionality, such as high contrast settings and text to speech output, to assist people with a broad spectrum of visual disabilities. However, for this to work well, websites need to be designed with proper markup and structures. For example, if the design is not flexible enough then the text overlaps, gets cropped, or doesn't reflow and people need to scroll horizontally to read; or the colors cannot be changed; or the images look distorted when they are enlarged. | [New scene; switch to another person (#2) from the initial collage in the first scene; this person will likely be featured in the "Visual" video (see [Visual page]([url](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-visual/))); again the focus is more on the technology than on the person.] We see a person (#2) using screen magnification software to start a web browser from the desktop and start reading a website. We see the person navigating through an enlarged desktop to locate and start the browser, type in a web address, and start reading the text. The colors are inverted/high-contrast and the individual words are being highlighted as they are being read aloud [we don't hear the audio and also don't see the website/text in great detail, just enough to get an impression]. |
| 4 | 1:40 - 2:15 | People with auditory disabilities might also need to adjust the presentation of content. For example, some people need to increase the volume of online meetings and multimedia like videos, podcasts, and music without increasing the volume of other system sounds, such as notification alerts. Some people might also need to adjust the bass, treble, and balance of the sound to make the audio easier to hear. Many operating systems and media players provide such settings but unfortunately not all. | [New scene; switch to person (#3) who also happens to be person #3 in the [Auditory script]([url](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/auditory/)); this scene uses similar visuals as scene 5 in the [Auditory script]([url](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/auditory/)) but possibly from another angle that focuses more on the technology than on the person.] We see a person (#3) watching a video and adjusting their hearing aid. We see the person (#3) adjust the volume of the video independently from other audio [we see a sound mixer widget with multiple volume sliders, and they adjust one of the volume sliders on the mixer]. |
| 5 | 2:15 - 2:45 | Also, many people with different types of cogntive and learning disabilities adjust the presentation of the content in a variety of ways. For example, some people with reduced attention and short term memory use the so-called reading mode provided by some web browsers. This setting hides less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and headers. Some web browsers also provide options to turn off pop-ups and automatically playing animations, to avoid distraction and interruption. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Preety) who will be featured in a separate video (see [Pretty's story page]([url](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-eight/))).] We see a person (#4/Preety) using a web browser to read a longer article. She clicks a "reading mode" button on her web browser, which presents the main content more prominently without the navigation, sidebar, and heading areas. |
| 6 | 2:45 - 3:10 | Some people with dyslexia use reading tools to change the font type, size, colors, and spacing of text, to make text easier to read. For example, some people read better with serif-type fonts while others with non-serif fonts. Also, the other properties of how text is presented are highly individual from one person to another, which is why flexible design is so important. | [New scene; switch to another person (#5) who will likely be featured in the "Cognitive, learning, and neurological" video (see [Cognitive, learning, and neurological page]([url]([https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-visual/](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-cognitive/)))).] We see the person (#5) changing the settings in a dialog window (e.g. of a browser plug-in) to adjust the font type, size, and spacing before the person (#5) starts a focused reading session. |
| 7 | 3:10 - 3:45 | Some people use reading tools with yet more functionality. For example, some people with Down syndrome use reading tools that scan the text and provide glossary descriptions for complex words and phrases. Some tools can also simplify some of the complex sentences, increase the space between paragraphs, or provide a virtual reading ruler to help readers to focus on one line at a time. Yet all these tools rely on proper markup and structures to change the presentation of the content. | [New scene; switch to person (#6/Luis) who will be featured in a separate video (see [Luis' story page]([url](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-five/))).] We see the person (#6/Luis) using a different reading tool. We see the person (#6/Luis) reading slowly and focused. The current line is highlighted (reading ruler) and some words are softly underlined. The person (#6/Luis) hovers with the mouse over one of these underlined words and we see a glossary description with image appearing to explain the word (it's a mildly complex word, like "excavate" or such). |
| 8 | 3:45 - 3:55 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the six protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person’s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
