Video script for [Presentation](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/tools-techniques-presentation/) from the page [Tools and Techniques](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/tools-techniques/) (in the [2020 Update](https://github.com/w3c/wai-people-use-web/wiki/Persona-development) version).

## Summary

* Narrated video (using voice-over to explain)
* Video features these 6 techniques:
  * Larger text size
  * Screen magnification, also with high-contrast and text-to-speech
  * Increased audio volume, also with bass, treble, and balance adjustments
  * Reading mode
  * Text customization (font type, size, colors, and spacing)
  * Reading assistant with glossary, text simplification, and reading ruler
* Focuses on the above techniques but features the following protagonists:
  * (#1/Yun) uses larger text (Yun will also be featured in the script for [Yun's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-nine/))
  * (#2) uses screen magnification, high-contrast, and text-to-speech (this person will likely also be featured in the script for [Visual page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-visual/))
  * (#3) uses hearing aid and increased audio volume (this person was featured in the [Auditory script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/auditory/))
  * (#4/Preety) uses reading mode (Preety will also be featured in the script for [Preety's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-eight/))
  * (#5) uses text customization (this person will likely also be featured in the script for [Cognitive, learning, and neurological page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-cognitive/))
  * (#6/Luis) uses reading assistant (Luis will also be featured in the script for [Luis's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-five/))

## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | When content is designed right, people can adjust its presentation to make it easier to distinguish and understand. | We see a collage of six people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:35 | For example, some people with low vision increase the text size to make it easier to read. They use settings in the operating systems of computers and mobile devices to resize the text in apps, and in web browsers to resize the text in websites. However, for these settings to work, apps, web browsers, and websites all have to be programmed and designed to adapt to increased text size. Otherwise, the text overlaps, gets cropped, or creates difficult scrolling. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1/Yun) who is featured in a separate video too (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see person (#1/Yun) opening a web browser with text on a website that appears too small. He uses a widget on the web browser to increase the text size, and we see the website starts to crumble as he increases the text size to read it (text starts overlapping, getting cropped, getting lost, horizontal scroll bars appearing, ...). |
| 3 | 0:35 - 1:05 | Other people with low vision increase everything on the screen, not only text. They use screen magnification software as a digital magnifying glass. Some might also change the text and background colors to better read the text, and use text-to-speech to hear the text while they are reading. [brief pause to listen to a short slice of text-to-speech while it is being shown in the visuals] This, again, means that websites and apps need to be programmed and designed accordingly. For example, to allow for colors to be changed by the reader rather than forcing them to appear in a certain way. | [New scene.] We see a person (#2) using screen magnification software to start a web browser from the desktop and start reading a website. We see the person navigating through an enlarged desktop to locate and start the browser, type in a web address, and start reading the text. The colors are inverted/high-contrast and the individual words are being highlighted as they are being read aloud [we hear some of the audio from text-to-speech as we see this sequence]. |
| 4 | 1:05 - 1:35 | Presentation is not only visual, though. People with auditory disabilities, for example, might also need to increase the volume of online meetings and multimedia like videos, podcasts, and music but without increasing the volume of other system sounds, like notification alerts. Adjusting the bass, treble, and balance of the sound can also make the audio easier to hear, making it vital that operating systems and media players provide such settings. Also, these settings work best with good quality audio that does not have background noise. | [New scene; switch to person (#3) who also happens to be person #3 in the [Auditory script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/auditory/).] We see a person (#3) watching a video and adjusting their hearing aid. We see the person (#3) adjust the volume of the video independently from other audio [we see a sound mixer widget with multiple volume sliders, and they adjust one of the volume sliders on the mixer]. |
| 5 | 1:35 - 1:55 | Presentation adjustments can also make content easier to focus on, particularly for people with different types of cogntive and learning disabilities. This includes, for example, web browser "reading modes" that hide less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and headers; pop-up and animation blockers that help avoid distraction and interruption; and digital reading rules that help readers focus on one line at a time. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Preety) who is featured in a separate video (see [Preety's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/preety/)).] We see a person (#4/Preety) using a tablet to read a longer article. She switches on a "reading mode" on the browser, which presents the main content more prominently without the navigation, sidebar, and heading areas. She also switches on a reading ruler, which highlights a portion of the text. She uses her finger to drag the reading ruler along the article while she is reading line by line. |
| 6 | 1:55 - 2:20 | Some reading assistants, for example those that some people with dyslexia might use, change the font type, text size, colors, and the spacing between letters, sentences, and paragraphs, to make text easier to read. For example, some read better with serif-type fonts while others with non-serif fonts. Other properties of how text is presented are also highly individual from one person to another, which is why flexible design is so important. | [New scene; switch to another person (#5) who also happens to be person #1 in the [Cognitive script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/cognitive/)).] We see the person (#5) changing the settings in a dialog window (e.g. of a browser plug-in) to adjust the font type, size, and spacing before the person (#5) starts a focused reading session. |
| 7 | 2:20 - 2:35 | Other reading assistants support reading comprehension. For example, some can scan the text and provide glossary descriptions for complex words and phrases, and sometimes also simplify complex sentences. Yet also these rely on proper programming and design to work. | [New scene; switch to person (#6/Luis) who is featured in a separate video (see [Luis' script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/luis/)).] We see the person (#6/Luis) using a different reading tool. We see some of the words and phrases are softly underlined. The person (#6/Luis) hovers with the mouse over one of these underlined words and we see a glossary description with image appearing to explain/illustrate the word (it's a mildly complex word, like "excavate" or such). |
| 8 | 2:35 - 2:40 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the six protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each personâ€™s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
