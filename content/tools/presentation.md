## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | One of the great things about digital technology – when it’s designed right – is that it allows people to change the way content is presented. Having options helps people with many types of disabilities. | @@@ |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, people with visual disabilities might need larger text and images sizes, or higher contrast between text and background colors to see the content better. Most operating systems allow users to adjust their preferred text size. Web browsers, apps, and content should respect these settings. Web browsers and document readers also need to provide functionality to "zoom" into the content, to enlarge text and image sizes. Content that is well designed reflows and adjusts to the zooming, to remain readable. Some people need further magnification and use specialized tools to make adjustments. These include hand held lenses and other visual aids, as well as software tools and functionality built into the operating system of the computer. Some people use software tools that provide other types of adaptation, such as changing the font type, colors, and spacing to make text more readable. | @@@ |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with auditory disabilities might need to adjust the sound too. For example, some people need to increase the volume of online meetings and multimedia like videos, podcasts, and music without increasing the volume of other system sounds, such as notification alerts. Some people might also need to adjust the bass, treble, and balance of the sound to make the audio easier to hear. | @@@ |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with cogntive and learning disabilities might also need to adjust the presentation of the content to make it easier to understand and to use. For example, some people rely on web browsers and software tools that make text easier to read. They provide functionality to customize font type, colors, and spacing of text, for people with cognitive disabilities that impacts their vision. They can also provide functionality to hide less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and headers, stop or remove animations and other distracting content. Or they provide outlines of the page headings to make the text easier to overview and read. Some provide descriptions and glossary definitions for complex words and phrases. Some software can also read the content aloud and highlight the text at the same time, for example for people with dyslexia. Howrver, all these tools only work when the content is properly designed with the necessary structures and markup. | @@@ |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | @@@ |
