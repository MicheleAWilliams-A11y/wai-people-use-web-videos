## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | One of the great things about digital technology – when it’s designed right – is that it allows people to change the way content is presented. Having options helps people with many types of disabilities. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, Yun needs larger text for reading. He adjusted the settings for larger text on his laptop computer and mobile phone, which are also used by his favorite web browser and many of the apps he installs. Unfortunately, some apps don't respect these settings and have text that is too small for Yun to read. Some websites are also not well designed and the text overlaps, gets cropped, or doesn't reflow with Yun's larger text size. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1/Yun) shown in the collage in the previous scene; Yun will be featured in a video (see [Yun's story page]([url](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-nine/))).] We see person (#1/Yun) using a mobile phone with noticeably larger text size (and icons). He opens an app that he just downloaded and is surprised by how small the text appears. He tries to enlarge/zoom using his fingers on the screen but the app doesn't respond to this gesture. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | <NAME> uses screen magnification software, which enlarges all content including text and images. <HE/SHE> also uses the high contrast colors and text to speech functionality in <HIS/HER> screen magnification software. This makes the text easier for <HIM/HER> to see, so that <HE/SHE> can follow along the text being read aloud. This works well on <HIS/HER> favorite websites but unfortunately not on all websites <HE/SHE> needs to use. For example, one of <HIS/HER> company websites uses images that look distorted when they are enlarged and the text colors cannot be changed either. | [New scene; switch to another person (#2) from the initial collage in the first scene; this person will likely be featured in the "Visual" video (see [Visual page]([url](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-visual/))).] We see a person (#2) using screen magnification software to start a web browser from the desktop and start reading a website. We see the person navigating through an enlarged desktop to locate and start the browser, type in a web address, and start reading the text. The colors are inverted/high-contrast and the individual words are being highlighted as they are being read aloud [we do not hear the audio and also do not see the website/text in great detail, just enough to get the impression]. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with auditory disabilities might also need to adjust the presentation of content. For example, to better hear, <NAME> needs to increase the volume of online meetings and multimedia like videos, podcasts, and music without increasing the volume of other system sounds, such as notification alerts. <HE/SHE> also needs to adjust the bass, treble, and balance of the sound to make the audio easier to hear. | [New scene; switch to person (#3) who also happens to be person #3 in the [Auditory script]([url](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/auditory/)); same visuals as scene 5 in the [Auditory script]([url](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/abilities/auditory/).] We see a person (#3) watching a video and adjusting their hearing aid. We see the person (#3) adjust the volume of the video independently from other audio [we see a sound mixer widget with multiple volume sliders, and they adjust one of the volume sliders on the mixer]. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Also, many people with cogntive and learning disabilities adjust the presentation of the content in different ways. For example, Preety uses a reading tool for people with dyslexia, which helps her adjust the font type, colors, and spacing of text, to make it easier to read. It's a plug-in for her favorite web browser, which has a reading mode that hides less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and headers. The browser also avoids pop-ups and automatically playing animations, which interrupt her attention. She finds this combination to work well on most websites she uses frequently. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Preety) who will be featured in a video (see [Pretty's story pgae]([url](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-eight/))).] We see a person (#4/Preety) using a web browser and reading tool plug-in to read a longer article. She first clicks a "reading mode" button on her web browser, which hides the navigation, sidebar, and heading to focus on the main content. She then uses a dialog (the plug-in) to adjust the font type, size, and spacing before she starts a focused reading session. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | <NAME> uses a different type of reading tool that is also a web browser plug-in. It scans the text and provides glossary descriptions for complex words and phrases. It can also simplify some of the complex sentences, increase the space between paragraphs, and provide a virtual reading ruler to help <HIM/HER> focus on one line at a time. Unfortunately, some websites aren't designed with adequare structures and markup for this functionality to work reliably, which makes it very hard to <NAME> to understand the content. | [New scene; switch to another person (#5) who will likely be featured in the "Cognitive, learning, and neurological" video (see [Cognitive, learning, and neurological page]([url]([https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-visual/](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-cognitive/)))).] We see a person (#5) using a different reading tool. We see the person (#5) reading slowly and focused. The current line is highlighted (reading rules) and some words are softly underlined. The person (#5) hovers with the mouse over one of these underlined words and we see a glossary description with image appearing to explain the word (it's a mildly complex word, like "excavate" or such). |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person’s setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
