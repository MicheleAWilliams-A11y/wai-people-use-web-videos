## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | [Yun:] Hello! I'm Yun. I'm a retired architect. Life moves slower now that I'm retired, and I think my body does too [laughs]! | We see Yun speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Yun, who is an older adult.  [Viewers might his stronger glasses and hand tremors.] |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:34 | I see less and hear less than in my younger days. Also, my hands shake a little. My grandchildren live far away, so we see each other online instead. We also write to each other and send pictures. It's so much easier and quicker than going to the post office every time [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Yun (at home) in front of a computer with a webcam engaged in an online meeting with his grandchildren (possibly also his daughter, depending on filming logistics). |
| 3 | 0:34 - 0:59 | My trouble is all this small text! Why do they write so small? I know how to make the text size bigger but it doesn't work with all websites. Sometimes everything seems to break down -- the text overlaps or goes somewhere else or disappears completely. Or, I have to scroll sideways to read -- I don't have the time and energy for that [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Yun using the same computer as in the previous scene, only this time reading a newspaper online. The text looks very small, and Yun uses browser setting or keyboard shortcut to increase the text size. The website starts breaking (overlapping and disappearing text, and horizontal scroll bars appear). |
| 4 | 0:59 - 1:23 | The same with apps. I made the text bigger on my mobile phone. I can't see without that on such a small screen. Most apps work well with that but not the banking app. The text on that app is still small, and I need to use it to log into my bank account. I already called them several times about this but nothing happens. | [New scene.] We see Yun using a mobile phone with noticeably larger text and icons on the screen. We see Yun launching a banking app that has small text. We see Yun squinting and holding the phone more closely to read the text on the app. |
| 5 | 1:23 - 1:43 | It's not only reading, though. When the text is small, all the buttons and links are also small. Sometimes tiny. Especially on forms where you have to click and select all these things -- it's hard with my hands, they don't behave like they used to. | [New scene.] We see Yun back again on the computer from scenes 2 and 3. He is now subscribing to a newsletter and needs to click small checkboxes and radio buttons (they do not have labels, so that the text of these controls doesn't serve as click area). |
| 6 | 1:43 - 2:28 | Our grocery store now has an online shop, which is fantastic because I don't have to carry all the shopping any more [chuckles]. The text is big and it has big links and buttons. It just seems clearer and easier to find things -- everything is where it should be on every page. Usually, I have trouble remembering things, like the telephone number, address, and credit card details. This store remembers from before, so I only need to select the right address in the text field rather than needing to type it each time. I wish all websites could be that easy. | [New scene.] We see Yun using the same computer as in the previous scene, only this time he is shopping in an online store. It has generous click areas (e.g. the entire image and label for products) and big "next" and "back" buttons during the purchase process. We see Yun selecting his address and credit card number from previous entries stored in the browser, as we hear the narration describe this. |
| 7 | 2:28 - 2:35 | [Yun:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Yun speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
