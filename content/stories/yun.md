## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | Hello! I'm Yun. I see less and hear less than in my young days. Also, my hands shake a little. | We see Yun speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Yun, who is an older adult.  [Viewers might his stronger glasses and hand tremors.] |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:34 | A friend once said: your age doesn't reflect your soul [chuckles]. I'm staying young with all this technology. My grandchildren live far away, so we see each other online instead. We also write each other and send pictures and such. It's so much easier and quicker than going to the post office every time [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Yun (at home) in front of a computer with a webcam engaged in an online meeting with his grandchildren (possibly also his daughter, depending on filming logistics). |
| 3 | 0:34 - 0:59 | My trouble is all this small text! Why do they write so small? I know how to make the text size bigger but it doesn't work with all websites. Sometimes everything seems to break down -- the text overlaps or goes somewhere else or disappears completely. Or, I have to scroll sideways to read -- I don't have time and energy for that [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Yun using the same computer as in the previous scene, only this time reading a newspaper online. The text looks very small, and Yun uses browser setting or keyboard shortcut to increase the text size. The website starts breaking (overlapping and disappearing text, and horizontal scroll bars appear). |
| 4 | 0:59 - 1:23 | Same with apps. My daughter showed me how to make the text bigger on my mobile phone. I can't see without that on such a small screen. But the banking app is still all small, not like the other apps! I need to use that app to log into my bank account. I already called them several times about this but nothing happens. | [New scene.] We see Yun using a mobile phone with noticeably larger text and icons on the screen. We see Yun launching a banking app that has small text. We see Yun squinting and holding the phone more closely to read the text on the app. |
| 5 | 1:23 - 1:43 | It's not only reading, though. When the text is small, all the buttons and links are also small. Sometimes tiny! Especially on forms where you have to click and select all these things -- it's hard with my hands, they don't behave like they used to. | [New scene.] We see Yun back again on the computer from scenes 2 and 3. He is now subscribing to a newsletter and needs to click small checkboxes and radio buttons (they do not have labels, so that the text of these controls doesn't serve as click area). |
| 6 | 1:43 - 2:28 | But sometimes websites work well! Our grocery store now has an online shop, which is fantastic -- I don't have to carry all the shopping anymore [chuckles]. The text is big and it has big links and buttons. It just seems clearer and easier to find things -- everything is where it should be on every page. I can also store my address and credit card numbers because I have difficulty remembering them. But somehow the computer remembers my information for this website anyway -- all I have to do is select the address or credit card numbers without typing them each time. I wish all websites could be that easy. | [New scene.] We see Yun using the same computer as in the previous scene, only this time he is shopping in an online store. It has generous click areas (e.g. the entire image and label for products) and big "next" and "back" buttons during the purchase process. We see Yun selecting his address and credit card number from previous entries stored in the browser, as we hear the narration describe this. |
| 7 | 2:28 - 2:35 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Yun speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
