## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |

| 1 | 0:00 - 0:08 | Hi! I'm Noor, a high school senior at my School for the Deaf. I'm deafblind. I was born deaf and have progressive vision, loss which means I can still see things if they're large and up-close but I see less and less each year. | We see Noor signing directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Noor and realize that she is communicating through a sign language interpreter who is speaking what she signs [the voice we hear]. |
| 2 | 0:08 - 0:25 | I learned [American/British/...] sign language as a child but now I can't see when someone signs back to me. So, if I'm with someone who signs, like an interpreter, I adapted to using [name of tactile sign; for example, "hands-on-signing"]. It's a form of tactile signing where [briefly describe how it works; for example, "I place my hands over the hands of my interpreter, to understand what they are signing".] But not everybody knows how to sign. | [New scene.] We see Noor using tactile sign [excact form of tactile sign depends on the actual protagonist] with an interpreter. We see Noor is in an environment where she needs to understand something being said; for example, in a classroom. |
| 3 | 0:25 - 1:05 | This is why technology is so important to me -- it allows me to communicate with more people. At home, I have a computer that can enlarge my documents X times. I have a big screen but am still only seeing a very small portion of the screen, and an even smaller portion of the documents because it's like looking through a magnification lens. I can find my way around documents with headings and sections that look different. For example, this homework sheet uses a color for the instructions that is different from the questions, which makes it easier for me to recognize them. | [New scene.] We see Noor sitting (at home) at a computer with a very large monitor. We see her engaged in interaction and leaning in very closely to the monitor to read. We then shift over to see the screen with the school website she is speaking about. We scan over the navigation and main content area, and over a series of easy-to-distinguish headings with different levels as she mentions them. |
| 4 | 1:05 - 1:34 | Oh, and I'm learning to use braille too. Braille are those dots that you read with your fingers, and I have this really cool device called a "refreshable Braille display" -- it's a small device that I can take with me everywhere, unlike my computer. It has apps for email, web, and chat, and a special keyboard for typing in braille. I read the braille characters in a row on the device, which I'm slowly getting used to. It's always difficult to learn to use something new at first but I'm getting better at reading and typing braille, and I know it will make life easier when I go off to college and so. | [New scene.] We see Noor in a different environment (e.g. in another part of her home or at school) using a refreshable braille display. We see Noor scanning her fingertips over the braille letters; she looks focused and possibly revisiting letters and words with her fingers before refreshing the display. |
| 5 | 1:34 - 2:17 | But not all websites and apps work well with magnification or on my braille display. Like when I need to look up the bus schedule to meet up with my friends -- that table doesn't work well when I enlarge it on my computer. And forget about trying to read it in braille -- I can't tell what row or column I'm in and it just jumps all over the place! Honestly it makes me nervous because I can't as easily ask for help from people around me while I'm out, so I've been learning how to speak up and ask companies for more accessible websites and apps to help me stay independent. I'll be in college next year and I know if I can use my technology like I should be able to, I can accomplish all my goals and live exactly as I want to. | [New scene.] We see Noor at a bus stop busily engaged with her refreshable braille display. She looks a little anxiuos and maybe somewhat annoyed too. We shift over to the overhead display on the bus stop to see it has a notification reading "10 minutes delay" (this scene depends on filming logistics). |
| 6 | 2:17 - 2:24 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Noor speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
