## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Hello! I'm Noor. I'm deafblind. I was born deaf and have progressive vision loss. | We see Noor signing directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Noor and realize that she is communicating through a sign language interpreter who is speaking what she signs [the voice we hear]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I learned sign language as a child when I could see better but meanwhile I can't see when someone signs back to me. I use [name of tactile sign; for example, "hands-on-signing"], which is a form of tactile sign. [briefly describe how it works; for example, "I place my hands over the hands of my interpreter, to understand what they are signing".] | [New scene.] We see Noor using tactile sign [excact form of tactile sign depends on the actual protagonist] with an interpreter. We see Noor is in an environment where she needs to understand something being said; for example, in a classroom. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | This is why digital technology is so important to me -- it allows me to communicate so much more freely. I'm currently using a software that magnifies the entire screen X fold. Despite this big screen I have at home, I'm only seeing a very small portion of the screen at a time, and an even smaller portion of the content! I can find my way around websites and apps with headings and sections that stand out clearly. For example, my school website uses a different color for the navigation menu than for the main content area, which helps me know where I am. It also uses different text sizes and styles for the different heading levels, which helps me know in which section I am. | [New scene.] We see Noor sitting (at home) at a computer with a very large monitor. We see her engaged in interaction and leaning in very closely to the monitor to read. We then shift over to see the screen with the school website she is speaking about. We scan over the navigation and main content area, and over a series of easy-to-distinguish headings with different levels as she mentions them. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I'm learning braille too, which are tactile characters made of dots. I love my new and refreshable braille display -- it has apps for email, web, and chat, and it's small enough for me to take to school! But it's so difficult learning braille -- I can't always distinguish the small dots popping up on the display with my fingertips, and it still takes me a while to read difficult words. | [New scene.] We see Noor in a different environment (e.g. in another part of her home or at school) using a refreshable braille display. We see Noor scanning her fingertips over the braille letters; she looks focused and possibly revisiting letters and words with her fingers before refreshing the display. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I find that websites and apps that work well with magnification also tend to work well on my braille display. For example, on my school website the different headings levels are indicated on my braille display, just like they appear differently on my screen. I guess it has something to do with the programing. Unlike the bus app -- it doesn't work well. I can't read the schedules, I think because the tables are badly programmed. My friend says she has trouble understanding the tables too, and she can see! I also can't read the "news" section where delays and disruptions are listed -- how can I go meet my friends with an app like that?  | [New scene.] We see Noor at a bus stop busily engaged with her refreshable braille display. She looks a little anxiuos and maybe somewhat annoyed too. We shift over to the overhead display on the bus stop to see it has a notification reading "10 minutes delay" (this scene depends on filming logistics). |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Noor speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
