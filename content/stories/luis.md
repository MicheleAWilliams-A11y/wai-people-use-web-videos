## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Hello! I'm Luis. I have Down Syndrome, which makes me read and speak more slowly like that. [Listeners might notice that Luis is speaking with some difficulty.] | We see Luis speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Luis. [Viewers might notice aspects of his disability.] |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I love basketball! I played on my school team and am now playing in a club. We use an app for our team. It has a calendar with all our practices and games, I can record my results, and there is a chat function too. I can chat with the coach and my team mates, and we exchange photos and jokes and so [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Luis playing basketball (e.g. with others or just practicing on his own, depending on filming logistics). We then transition or Luis using the app (e.g. recording practice results, chatting with a team mate, looking up a date; possibly during or after playing basketball depending on filming logistics). |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | The app is really easy to use. The name of the event or of the player is at the top, so I know where I am. The calendar is also very clear with the name of the month or the number of the week also at the top too. Other apps we tried were too confusing -- I could never tell where I am and how to get back. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Luis using the app but now focus more on the app itself rather than on Luis and what he is doing. We see Luis looking at the page/view for an event, player, and calender as the narration mentions them. [The name of the event, player, month, etc. is clear and placed prominently at the top of the page/view; the app looks neat and tidy, and Luis looks enjoyed using it.] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | The biggest problem is buying tickets for basketball games. This ticketing app I usually buy from is easy to use -- but sometimes I have to use others to get tickets. Sometimes a window suddenly opens or I have to download a document. Or, it suddenly looks all different when I want to buy a ticket. I don't know where I am and how to get back. I also have trouble filling in these long and complicated forms. Sometimes they're so confusing. I wish buying tickets can be easier. | [New scene.] We see Luis using a ticketing app. It looks more crammed and he is looking more focused while using the app. We see Luis find a game and select "buy ticket", which takes him to a very differently looking form asking for billing and shipping details for the credit card purchase. Luis is looking more frustrated. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I work part-time at a library, sorting books. I'd like to work full-time on a more challenging job but many people don't think I can do it. I sent many applications but they don't get answered. A few times I was invited to an interview but still didn't get the job. I know I have trouble with difficult words and with math but I use an online dictionary and calculator to help me. Of course, it would be easier to just make things easier from the start so I don't have to spend time looking up words or dealing with difficult websites! | [New scene.] We see Luis sorting books in a library. We then transition to see Luis sitting in front of a computer at work. We see Luis reading more slowly and with some difficulty, and we see that he has an online dictionary open beside the text he is reading to lookup difficult words. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Luis speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
