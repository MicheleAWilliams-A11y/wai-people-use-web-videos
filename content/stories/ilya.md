## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | Hello! I'm Ilya. I lost my sight due to Type 1 Diabetes during my childhood, and have been blind since. I'm a senior accountant at a large company. | We see Ilya speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Ilya. [Viewers might notice that she is not looking directly into the camera because she does not see it, or other aspects of her disability.] |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:40 | On my work computer, I use software called a "screen reader". It describes information on the screen in audio or in braille. It indicates everything that's in the code -- like the headings in a web page, lists and how many list items they have, and tables and form controls. It's like a sighted assistant describing everything on the screen to me -- only much quicker [brief pause to listen to a short slice of screen reader at moderately high speed while the video is being shown in the visuals]. People are surprised at how fast I set the speech but I listen to this all day. | [New scene.] We see Ilya in a work enviroment (e.g. home office or office) with wired headphones connected to a computer. We scan over headings, lists, tables, and controls on the screen as the narrator mentions them. We stop at the brief piece of text as it is being read aloud (e.g. form instruction, input confirmation, or other brief piece of text). |
| 3 | 0:40 - 1:06 | Some screen readers, like the one on my work computer, are quite complex and take a lot of time to learn all the keyboard commands. I prefer the screen reader on my mobile phone, which is much easier to use. I can also just speak most actions I want on my phone instead of all the typing and swiping. If I could, I would use my phone for everything but I can't access my company network with personal devices. | [New scene.] We see Ilya in a casual environment (e.g. at home or at a cafe etc.) with wireless headphones and using a mobile phone. We see her swiping, tapping, and gesturing one a screen that is turned off. She is also dictating voice commands and listening attentively as she was on the work computer. |
| 4 | 1:06 - 1:37 | A few years ago the company I work for changed all desktop applications to online applications. I was concerned about that change because online applications often don't work well with screen readers, especially complex applications like the online spreadsheets, presentations, and documents that I need to use and edit. I'm glad that my company paid attention to that aspect during procurement and found a provider that ensured accessibility. | [New scene; continuation of Scene 2 where Ilya is at work.] We see Ilya back at work navigating through a complex online application (e.g. a document management system with a dense hierarchical navigation with lots of filenames being listed). We see her opening menu items and sub-items, and moving through tree-view structures and dialog windows. |
| 5 | 1:37 - 2:03 | The only issue is the online conferencing tool that I need to use to train our clients. Unfortunately, many of the buttons are not properly labeled so I don't know which is which. I memorized the "join" and "leave" buttons but cannot participate in the chat. It doesn't even notify me when there are new messages or who a message is from. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Ilya starting an online conferencing tool. We see her navigate to the "join" button and press it to enter a meeting. We see the chat area fill up with the names of the attendees and with messages that are being typed as the narration speaks [we don't really see the actual chat messages as closely, just that there is activity happening without Ilya]. |
| 6 | 2:03 - 2:45 | Outside work, I enjoy cooking, knitting, and travel. I join online groups to find recipes, knitting patterns, and to book travel but one of the biggest barriers for me are CAPTCHAS -- you know, these login screens where you have to prove that you're a human. Well, I **am** human! It's so humiliating and disruptive to have to get help, and there isn't always someone around that I want to get help from. I know it can be done differently because other websites have other options -- for example, they verify by email or text message. | [New scene; continuation of Scene 3 where Ilya is at home.] We see Ilya frustrated (maybe somewhat angry too). We see her turn the screen on and hand the phone to someone next to her (e.g. partner, child, room mate, ...) who completes the CAPTCHA for her [we don't hear what they speak, just see the interaction between the two]. |
| 7 | 2:45 - 2:52 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Ilya speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
