## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:08 | Hello! I'm Preety. I have dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- ADHD. | We see Preety speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Preety with no visible disability. |
| 2 | 0:08 - 0:30 | Aparently, many people have some form of dyslexia. I had big problems when I started with school because I couldn't read or write as quickly as others in my class. I thought it was me but then a doctor diagnosed dyslexia -- sometimes letters or entire words appear differently to me, and it takes me longer to process them. | [New scene.] We see Preety (maybe at home or in a classroom, depending on filming logistics) having difficulty reading printed words (e.g. typical reading exercises for first graders). Possibly we also see some of her writing, for example with individual letters written backwards (depending on filming logistics). |
| 3 | 0:30 - 1:02 | Digital books are so much better for me. On the computer, on a tablet, or -- my favorite -- on my new e-reader. I can change the font type, text size, and line spacing, which makes it easier for me to read. I also use the read-aloud function because I read better when I can see and hear the text at the same time. It also highlights the words being read aloud and has a reading ruler, so that I can follow along. | [New scene.] We see Preety using an e-reader too read a digital book. We see her changing the text properties (e.g. font type, text size, and line spacing) and follow along the text being read aloud and being highlighted on the screen at the same time (maybe Preety has earphones/headphone, depending on filming logistics. [We do not hear the actual reading but the camera might focus on the earphones, headphones, or loud speaker to indicate the audio.] |
| 4 | 1:02 - 1:40 | Our school uses digital books and online homework and such, which is much easier for me than printed books. But not all books are accessible, which is really frustrating. Some cannot be read aloud. Or, the reading jumps around in confusing ways because the book is badly coded. Or, I can't change the fonts and spacing. Also, sometimes teachers forget and put scanned text in the homework -- I can't change these or have them read aloud! | [New scene.] We see Preety reading a document (e.g. school material put together by a teacher) on a computer. We see the text properties change, similarly to how it changed in the previous scene, only that some text remains unchanged (e.g. images of text). We see also similar highlighting as we did in the previous scene, only that the highlighting is now jumping around in unusual order (e.g. between floating charts/images/objects and their labels) or completely disappearing in between. |
| 5 | 1:40 - 2:22 | A bigger problem is when I have to do online research. I land on all these websites with text that is so difficult to follow -- it's so much text without any spaces and sections! Or, all these advertisements and things popping up and moving around the screen. I use several pop-up blockers and reading tools but they don't work on some websites. When I find an article I want to read, I switch to reading mode in my browser, which usually removes all the stuff around the page -- like the ads -- and let's me focus on the text. But sometimes the ads still appear, or the text is too difficult for me to read. | [New scene.] We see Preety using the same computer as in the previous scene, only one using a web browser instead of reading a document. We see Preety search for some phrase (e.g. "effects of climate change"), and start to read an article. The article looks very dense with a crowded navigation, sidebar, and header. It's a wall of text with little spacing and headings that are difficult to distinguish. We see Preety turn on reading mode, which removes the navigation, sidebar, and header, making the page look a little less cluttered. We also see her adjust other settings, which change the text properties (e.g. font type, text size, and line spacing). Just as she gets comfortable and starts reading, a pop-up/dialog appears with an annoying ad (e.g. "free 30-day subscription"). Preety looks frustrated as she clicks away this ad. |
| 6 | 2:22 - 2:45 | Having ADHD also means I can't easily follow really long articles. Some articles have more spacing, headings and structure, and illustrations to make them easier to follow. Soemtimes they are also on multiple pages, like a book, so that I can have small breaks after reading each page. | [New scene.] We see Preety in the same setting as in the previous scene, only now reading a different article on the same topic (e.g. "effects of climate change"). This article looks much more structured. It has ~3-5 sub-pages listed clearly with clear topics, generous whitespace, distinguishable headings, page numbering, indication of current page, back and forward arrows to the sibling pages, illustrations/graphics, and such. |
| 7 | 2:45 - 2:52 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Preety speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
