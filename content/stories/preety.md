## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Stefan, student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Stefan, student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Stefan:] Hello! I'm Stefan. I have dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- ADHD. | We see Stefan speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Stefan with no visible disability. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I have difficulty recognizing or sounding out written words, even though I use those same words in conversation all the time. It affects my spelling and my reading comprehension. It often takes me a long time to figure out the individual words I'm reading, and then it's hard for me to remember how the words in a sentence fit together in a meaningful way. My dyslexia also causes uneven memory for me. It was difficult for me when I started school. At first, I couldn't understand why it was so difficult for me to learn how to read and spell, even though I'm bright and was trying my best. Then a doctor said I have dyslexia. Apparently, many people have some form of dyslexia. Now I know what it is, and that I won't grow out of it. | [New scene.] We see Stefan (maybe at home or in a classroom, depending on filming logistics) doing homework, for example doing specialized exercises, such as dividing a printed word into syllables (by using a pencil to "scoop" or make a semicircle under each syllable) or moving around square letter tiles on a magnetic board, with the consonant tiles all in one color and the vowel tiles all in another color (to help kids with dyslexia focus on the vowel sounds). [Stefan is a smart student who has difficulty reading, and should appear that way.] |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Digital books and documents are often much better for me. On the computer, on a tablet, or – my favorite – on my new e-reader. I can change the font type, text size, and line spacing, which makes it easier for me to read. I also use the read-aloud function because I read better when I can see and hear the text at the same time. It also highlights the words being read aloud and has a reading ruler, so that I can follow along more easily. | [New scene.] We see Stefan using an e-reader to read a digital book. We see his changing the text properties (e.g. font type, text size, and line spacing) and the text adapts accordingly. We see Stefan follow along the text being read aloud and being highlighted on the screen at the same time (maybe Stefan has earphones/headphone, depending on filming logistics. [We do not hear the actual reading but the camera might focus on the earphones, headphones, or loud speaker to indicate the audio.] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Sometimes, though, digital books and documents don't work well. Sometimes they are just scanned images. These also can't be read aloud and I can't change the text size and font. Some don't have sections in the table of contents, which I use to jump to the parts I want to focus on. Or, the sections have long chunks of text without any headings to separate them, so I have difficulty focusing on the content. It is so much easier when text has more spacing and graphics to make them easier to follow. | [New scene.] We see Stefan reading a document (e.g. school material put together by a teacher) on a computer. We see him try to change the text properties similarly to how it changed in the previous scene, only that the text remains unchanged. We also see long chunks of text without any headings to separate the content. We see Stefan has difficulty navigating and using this document. We see Stefan close this document and open a different one. This document looks much more structured with table of contents, generous whitespace, distinguishable headings, page numbering, indication of current page, illustrations/graphics, and such. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Another problem is when I have to do online research. I type in words, but sometimes I do it wrong, or use a different word that sounds the same, like "brake" when I mean "break". Luckily my computer has parental controls to avoid me getting in trouble with mistakes. Sometimes I land on websites with all these advertisements and things popping up and moving around the screen. With ADHD, I get distracted by these ads and videos, and sometimes I click on them and forget what I was meant to be doing. I use several pop-up blockers but they don't work on websites that dodge them. | [New scene.] We see Stefan using the same computer as in the previous scene, only one using a web browser instead of reading a document. We see Stefan start to type some search phrase (e.g. "effects of climate change"), and we see word prediction/completion happening in the search field. We see Stefan select one of the suggestions without needing to type out the entire phrase. We see Stefan selecting one of the search results, and just as he gets comfortable and starts reading, a pop-up/dialog appears with an annoying ad (e.g. "free 30-day subscription"). Stefan looks frustrated as he clicks away this ad. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | When I find an article I want to read, I try to remember to switch to reading mode in my browser. This usually removes all the stuff around the page and lets me focus on the text. But some websites don't work well and the ads still appear, or the text is too difficult for me to read. I love it when websites work well with my settings and extensions. Like, the extension for spelling and grammar, which helps me when I'm typing things like email. That's very important for me. | [New scene.] We see Stefan in the same setting as in the previous scene, only now writing article on the same topic (e.g. "effects of climate change"). We see the words get underlined with red as Stefan types them, and we see Stefan going back to correct them. We see Preet turning on a word-prediction extension that helps his select from words as he starts typing the first letters. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Stefan:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Stefan speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
