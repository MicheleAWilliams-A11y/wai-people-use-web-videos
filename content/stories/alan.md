## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:07 | Hello! I'm Alan. I have a spinal cord injury since an accident X years ago. I'm quadriplegic, which means I have limited movement in my arms as well as my legs. | We see Alan speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Alan sitting in a wheelchair and gesturing to show he his hands and fingers as he speaks about them. [Viewers might notice his hands and fingers don't move as he gestures with his arms.] |
| 2 | 0:07 - 0:23 | A keyboard that I can use is really important to me. I need the keys to be larger and further apart so that I can type with my limited dexterity. Many keyboards have flat keys, which make my fingers slip and I make too many mistakes. | [New scene.] We see Alan typing on a keyboard, and zoom in to see the larger keys that are further apart and that have small ergonomic indents. We also focus on Alan's hands with limited dexterity (e.g. no or limited movement of the fingers, typing with only one or two fingers). |
| 3 | 0:23 - 0:50 | I can also use a mouse that is big enough but I prefer to use my joystick with custom-made lever -- it has this flat U-shape in the size of my hand. It also has larger buttons -- I use the joystick turned around towards me so that I can press the buttons with my palms instead of my fingers. I also reduced the speed of the mouse pointer so that it doesn't go flying all around the screen. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Alan removing one hand from the keyboard and reaching for the custom-made joytick lever. We focus on the lever that fits around his hands, and on the turned-around joystick. We see Alan hitting one of the buttons with his palms while leaving the rest of his hand on the lever. |
| 4 | 0:50 - 1:19 | While I can use a keyboard and mouse, I canâ€™t use them for long periods because it's tiring. It's particularly tiring to keep switching between keyboard and mouse -- or, my joystick. I got accustomed to using the keyboard and shortcut keys over the years, especially for the programs that I often use. For example, scrolling a page is much easier with the arrow keys on the keyboard than by clicking on that small button in the scroll bars. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Alan switching back from using the joystick to the keyboard to type in something brief, then back again to the joystick to continue navigating (e.g. clicking "next" button after typing in something brief on a form). We see Alan using the down-arrow key to scroll down a web page (e.g. the newly loaded page after clicking "next). This back-and-forth switching seems strenuous. |
| 5 | 1:19 - 1:47 | Unfortunately, many websites and apps don't work well with keyboard. Often the focus indicator, which highlights the currently active object on the screen, is not visible or it jumps around completely out of order. Usually, the Tab-key should take me object by object. At other times, typing does not work -- for example, I have to select a date in small widget instead of just typing it. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Alan now using the Tab-key to move between objects on the web page (e.g. a form in the newly loaded page, the one he was scrolling on). The focus indicator first moves in a logical order (e.g. from "street address" to "post code"), then it jumps somewhere completely unexpected (e.g. "use same as shipping address" at the top of the form, which disables the text fields that Alan just filled in when he check it). |
| 6 | 1:47 - 2:10 | Sometimes websites and apps work better on my tablet than on the computer because I can click the buttons and links on the touch screen with my knuckles. I can also type the same way on the on-screen keyboard. Only that some websites and apps don't work in landscape orientation, which is how I setup my tablet so that the buttons are big enough for me to click. | [New scene.] We see Alan using a tablet computer in landscape orientation (e.g. mounted to his wheelchair or on a stand). We see it first works well, then it doesn't anymore (e.g. Alan clicks the icon of his email program; reads a new email from a friend; follows a link in that email; the website opens in portrait orientation -- sideways for Alan). |
| 7 | 2:10 - 2:45 | I recently started using speech control software as well. It allows me to dictate text instead of typing, and to say certain commands instead of clicking. It's really hard to learn a new way of working after so many years but I've been patient with it and am slowly getting used to it. The most difficult thing is when websites and apps are incorrectly coded, so when I say "click search" or "click next" it doesn't work as expected. It holds me up trying to figure out what went wrong and find a work around. | [New scene.] We see Alan speaking (we only see his mouth move but don't hear what he is saying), and see the words appearing on the screen. We see the words being corrected on the screen (e.g. "white flour" being corrected to "white flowers" in the search field of an online grocery shop). We zoom in on a button beside the search field visually labeled "search" (we don't really see what happens next but from the narration and the way that nothing happens visually, some viewers might assume there is something wrong with the button). |
| 8 | 2:45 - 2:52 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Alan speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
