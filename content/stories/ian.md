## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:05 | Hello! I'm Ian. I'm autistic. I work for a software company three bus stops from my home. | We see Ian speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Ian with no immediately apparent aspects of his disability [possibly some subtle aspects depending on the actual protagonist]. |
| 2 | 0:05 - 0:18 | I'm a data entry clerk. I enjoy my work very much. Others find this work difficult because it's quite technical, but for me it's really easy. | [New scene.] We see Ian on the way to work (e.g. in a bus, at a bus station, or walking down a street). We then see Ian at his workspace (possibly greeting and being greeted by colleagues as he makes his way to his workspace; this depends on the filming options). We see Ian settling in and starting to work. |
| 3 | 0:18 - 0:39 | Except when something changes. Sometimes it's just a new version of the computer program I use. It's confusing if I'm not prepared for changes in how things usually work. Our administrator usually shows me the changes before an update is installed on my computer to avoid surprises. | [New scene.] We see Ian at his workspace with a colleague, presumably the administrator, explaining something on the computer. Ian is nodding. We the an update in progress on the computer screen. |
| 4 | 0:39 - 1:03 | But once I was also stopped from working because I got this very scary message -- it was in red and big capital letters; something about user error such and such. Boy! I thought, what did I do now?! But it was just a small mistake in the date. That was some fright! | [New scene.] We see Ian at his workspace on a different day (e.g. workspace is slightly modified, Ian's clothes are different, ...). We see Ian entering data in a form (in a different program, if the previous one was visible). We turn to the screen and see a rediculously obnoxious warning message in red and capital letters (e.g. "USER ERROR #48709402 DATA CHECK DATETIME FORMAT INCORRECT") pop-up suddenly. We see Ian getting increasingly anxious while trying to figure out the issue. |
| 5 | 1:03 - 1:24 | I love to cook when I'm not working. I'm not a good cook yet but I'm learning. Some cooking websites and apps are easy to use -- they list the exact ingredients and have step-by-step instructions. It's easy to find the recipes in the navigation and to understand them. | [New scene.] We see Ian in a kitchen with cooking cloak following cooking instructions on a nearby digital assistant with screen. We zoom onto the screen and see cooking instructions that are laid out very clearly (e.g. uses grouping, whitespace, headings, lists, ...). Ian looks happy. |
| 6 | 1:24 - 1:43 | Other websites and apps are very confusing. Especially these where all sorts of videos start playing and pop-up windows start appearing without me even pressing anything. I didn't ask for this! Why is it giving me all this stuff instead of the recipe? | [New scene.] We see the same screen with other cooking instructions, this time it seems very crammed with no apparent layout. We see an overlay appear and a video starting to play automatically (we don't hear the video, just see how all the content is suddenly obscured by the overlay and the video playing). [We don't see Ian in this scene, only the screen; if we see Ian, he has different clothes and the kitchen has other utensils, food, and such because he is cooking something else.] |
| 6 | 1:43 - 2:08 | Or, some use all these confusing words and phrases and don't even bother explaining them. I had to ask a friend what "scant cup of brown sugar" means. Why don't they just somewhere say that a scant is a cooking cup filled just below the top? That would be easier to understand for everyone. | [New scene.] We see Ian cooking. He has different clothes and the kitchen has other utensils, food, and such because he is cooking something else. We don't see the screen (e.g. it is facing away from us) but Ian is looking at the screen trying to follow the instructions, and looking increasingly frustrated. |
| 7 | 2:08 - 2:15 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Ian speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
