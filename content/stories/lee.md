| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Hello! I'm Lee. I was born with deuteranopia and protanopia, which people call “color blindness”. | We see Lee speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Lee with no visible disability. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I have difficulty distinguishing among red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear to me as kind of murky brown. Online shopping has many advantages for me, most of all is that the colors of the clothes I want to buy, are described. In a store, I often can't tell the color of two shoes or two shirts beside each other. | [New scene.] We see Lee in a casual environment (e.g. at home or at a cafe etc.) using a computer. We see the computer screen with lots of colors, including red, green, orange, and brown as they are mentioned. We realize that Lee is shoping clothes, selecting colors of a product (e.g. shirt, shoe, etc.) with the names of the colors changing as he selects them  [we intentionally will not turn all colors to brown or such]. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Well, often only until I get to the sign-up or check-out forms for some of the online shops! I can't tell you how often they say "fields in red are mandatory" or such. I prefer websites that indicate these fields in text as well as color. For example, they put that little asterisk beside the mandatory fields or the word "optional" beside non-mandatory fields. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Lee continuing to the check-out area; he's a new customer to this website and is asked to register. The registration form has many fields (e.g. street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...), some of which are in red. We see the note "Fields in red are manadatory", and we see Lee focusing on the screen more closely. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Other websites and apps do this mistake quite frequently too! For example, my favorite fantasy football app has a symbol for each team on the jersy of the players, in addition to color. This helps me spot the players on my team more quickly, not just by reading the names under each player. Unfortunately, my friends are not so sold on this app yet and I have some more convincing to do. | [New scene.] We see Lee in a casual enviroment (same or different setting, depending on filming logistics), who is now playing a fantasy football game. We see the players of the two teams have differently colored jerseys with different symbols as well. Lee is very engaged in the game (e.g. biting his tongue, moving around with the game controller, ...). |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Color issues also happen at work. For example, when my colleagues highlight words in a document without using the commenting function. The commenting function outlines the marked text in addition to highlighting it. Or, when they use charts without providing legends, so that I can associate the bars or lines without relying on color. My team knows differently but many suppliers we work with still don't [sigh]. | [New scene.] We see Lee in a work enviroment (e.g. home office or office) reading a document with comments indicated (e.g. in the document margin). The corresponding text areas are outlined and highlighted as Lee selects the comments. We then see Lee studying a bar chart using different colors for the different bars, in addition to a legend that identifies each bar by label. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Lee speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
