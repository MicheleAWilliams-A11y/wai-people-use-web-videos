## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:15 | Hello! I'm Martine. I'm deaf. I can hear some sounds but not enough to understand speech. [British/American/TBD] sign language is my native language -- I think and dream in signs. | We see Martine signing directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Martine and realize that she is communicating through a sign language interpreter who is speaking what she signs [the voice we hear]. |
| 2 | 0:15 - 0:35 | I recently enrolled in an online degree. For my classes, I schedule interpreters who sign the conversations and speak aloud my comments. I need video conferencing apps with functionality to "pin" videos of the interpreters so that I can always see them. | [New scene.] We see Martine in a video conference meeting with multiple people online. We see two sign language interpreters join the meeting. The windows for the interpreters are labeled accordingly, and we see Martine take particular attention to these two windows. We see Martine use a "pin to screen" function for the interpreters and for the current speaker. We see her signing back to the interpreter to speak up in the meeting. We don't really see the exact signs or hear the interpreter while the scene transitions, we just see that she is actively participating in the meeting. |
| 3 | 0:35 - 1:15 | Some lectures have realtime captioning by real humans. This is more accurate than automatic captions, which don’t recognize specialized terms and names. They also don't recognize who is speaking and can run sentences together, which makes it hard to keep up. For our assigned videos, however, I rely on closed captions. These are edited so that they are not too long and are properly synchronized with the audio. And because none of us are getting any younger, you know, I often find myself needing to adjust the text size and colors of the captions, to be able to read them better. Some apps also allow me to move the captions to the top or bottom of the video, so that they are not in the way. | [New scene.] We see Martine watching an online lecture with captions. [We see that the captions indicate who is speaking but don't see enough to actually read the entire text.] We see Martine switching from the live lecture to a pre-recorded video (e.g. browse through a collection of videos and select one of them). We see Martine switching on captions for that video and adjusting the text size. We also see Martine moving the captions above the video where she can see them better. |
| 4 | 1:15 - 1:40 | In some situations, I find myself lip reading. For example, when I'm on unplanned calls without interpreters or other people who can sign. I learned lip reading over the years because of such situations but it's not always reliable. I need to see the person's mouth, have them speak slowly and clearly, and seeing their gestures also helps. Yet it's exhausting and not really something I can keep doing for too long. | [New scene.] We see Martine in a video conference meeting with multiple people online, similar to that in scene #2. This time, there are no sign language interpreters present. She is focusing on the mouth of the person speaking. She is trying to understand what they are saying but the person is sometimes turning away from the camera (e.g. to point at a board or otherwise gesture). Martine is looking increasingly tired. |
| 5 | 1:40 - 1:55 | I also use the chat function. Some chat tools support realtime text rather than line-by-line text messages only. This is much more interactive, and I can engage with my friends in text conversations as others do by voice. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Martine using the chat function to exchange with other people on the call. Martine is engaged in the discussion and smiling as she types. |
| 6 | 1:55 - 2:20 | Of course, the classes also come with a whole lot of reading. I'm fine with that, except when the writing is unnecessarily complex and without structure like lists and headings. People don’t realize that for me reading text involves extra effort, because sign language is my native language. So, like for everyone else, clear and simple writing makes text easier to understand. | [New scene.] We see Martine having difficulty understanding a page with with long and justified paragraphs, little spacing, few headings that are hardly distinguishable, and without any structure. |
| 7 | 2:20 - 2:30 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Martine signing directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
