## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |

| 1 | @@@ | Hello! I'm Martine. I'm 62 years old and recently started to take online courses at my local university. I have been deaf since birth. I can hear some sounds but not enough to hear speech. | We see Martine signing directly to us viewers (documentary style into the camera), and the sign-language interpreter on the side speaking what she signs (the audio we hear). [Martine is the main character in this scene, we see just enough of the interpreter to understand that they are the ones speaking.] |
| 2 | @@@ | I can lip read to some extent when I can see the full face of the person, and when they speak slowly and clearly. I sometimes need that for lectures and events that I hadn't scheduled. It doesn't always work with some accents and dialects, or when people don't speak into the camera. It is also straneous for long periods. | We see Martine in what seems to be an online lecture, focusing on the mouth of the lecturer speaking. She is trying to understand what they are saying but the person is sometimes turning away from Martine to point at a board or otherwise gesture. Martine is looking visibly fatigued. |
| 3 | @@@ | Written language can also be difficult for me as someone who primarily uses sign language. Some lecturers use unnecessarily long sentences with complex words that make the text difficult to understand. Other lecturers use short paragraphs with clear structures, like headings, lists, and tables. These courses are much easier to follow. | We see Martine having difficulty understanding a page with with long and justified paragraphs, little spacing, few headings that are hardly distinguishable, and without any structure. Then we see her looking much more relieved reading another page with much more structure and smaller blocks of content. |
| 4 | @@@ | Sign language is my first language, and the one I'm most comfortable with. It is the language that I think and dream in. I booked some hours with a video relay service that provides real-time interpretation. I use that for lectures and meetings with other students that are scheduled in advance. I sign to the interpreters who speaks what I say, and who signs back to me what the others say. | We see Martine in a different video conference meeting with more people online. [It is a meeting setting rather than a lecture.] We see two sign language interpreters join the meeting. [The windows for the interpreters are labeled accordingly, and we see Martine take particular attention of these two windows.] |
| 5 | @@@ | In video conferencing apps, I need to be able to pin the window of the speaker and interpreters so that they are always visible. Unfortunately, some apps don't have this functionality. | We see Martine in front of a video conferencing app. [Continuation from previous scene.] We see her activate the "pin to screen" function for two interpreters and for the current speaker. We see her signing back to the interpreter to speak up in the meeting. [We don't really see the exact signs or hear the interpreter while the scene transitions.] |
| 6 | @@@ | For recorded classes, my university is increasingly adding captions. Unfortunately, not all courses I want to take have captions. | We see Martine browsing through videos of recorded classes (as thumbnails). We see that only one has a "Captioned" marking in the selection she is currently browsing through. Martine selects that one video, and starts watching it. |
| 7 | @@@ | Some videos have automatic captioning but it is too inaccurate for me. The acronyms, names, and technical phrases that are used in my classes turn out garbled, which is confusing. The automatic captions also don't identify who is currently speaking. | [Continuation from previous scene.]  We see Martine opening another video with automatic captioning turned on. We see a sentence with obviously garbled words, so that the sentence doesn't make sense. Martine looks puzzled. |
| 8 | @@@ | Quality captions identify who is currently speaking and background audio that is relevant. They are also synchronized with the audio, which helps me better lip read some of what is being said. | [Continuation from previous scene but now resembling scene 2 where she is watching a lecturer speak.]  We see Martine opening yet another video with marked as "Captioned". We see her observe the mouth of the speaker, similar to scene 2. |
| 9 | @@@ | Additionaly, my university is now also using a video player that allows me to change the text size, colors, and positioning of the captions. | We see Martine adjusting the captions to the text size that she prefers. |
| 10 | @@@ | Because, frankly, none of us are getting any younger [chuckles]. | We see Martine signing again directly to us, as in the first scene (documentary style into the camera). She chuckles sheepishly as she plays on her own age. |
