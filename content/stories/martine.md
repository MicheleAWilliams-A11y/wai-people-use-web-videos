| 1 | @@@ | Hello! I'm Martine. I'm 62 years old and recently started to take online courses at my local university | We see Martine signing directly to us viewers (documentary style into the camera), and the sign-language interpreter on the side speaking what she signs (the audio we hear). [Martine is the main character in this scene, we see just enough of the interpreter to understand that they are the ones speaking.] |
| 2 | @@@ | I have been deaf since birth. I can hear some sounds but not enough to hear speech. I can lip read to some extent when I can see the full face of the person and when they speak slowly and clearly. Sign language is my first language, and the one I'm most comfortable with. | We see Martine in a class listening to a lectuer and having difficulty understanding what they are saying because they keep turning away to point on the projected slides. We think that Martine is anguished but then realize that she looks to the side to a sign-language interpreter in the room. |
| 3 | @@@ | Even written language can sometimes be difficult for me as some who uses sign-language primarily. For example, long sentences with complex words can be difficult for me. Also, long paragraphs without any structure like lists and headings make reading difficult for me. | We see Martine having difficulty understanding a long and complext "Terms of Use" page for an app that she is trying to install on her tablet computer. |
| 4 | @@@ | For me, the biggest problem is all the online videos without any captions at all. Some videos have automatic captioning but it is too inaccurate for the courses I take with all the acronyms and technical phrases that the computer does not understand. Thankfully, my university has been adding quality captions to their video content. These are accurate and synchronized with the audio, which helps me better follow what is being said. | We realized that Martine had been installing a video streaming app and is browsing through videos. Out of all the videos that she is browsing through (as thumbnails), we see that only one has a "Captioned" marking. Martine selects that one video, which has the quality captions that she is talking about (via the interpreter). |
| 5 | @@@ | Actually, my university is now also using a video player that allows me to change the text size, colors, and positioning. | We see Martine adjusting the captions to the text size that she prefers. |
| 6 | @@@ | Because, frankly, non of us are getting any younger. | We see Martine signing again directly to us, as in the first scene (documentary style into the camera). She chuckles sheepishly as she plays on her own age. |
