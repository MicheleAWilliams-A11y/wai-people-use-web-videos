| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Cognitive and learning disabilities is an umbrella term for a large spectrum of differences and disabilities. They affect how people store, retrieve, or use information, and many do not affect overall intelligence. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, many people have different degrees of dyslexia, which impacts the perception of letters and words. Sometimes letters and words can appear out of order, which makes reading harder. Some change the font type, text size, colors, and the spacing between letters, sentences, and paragraphs, to make text easier to read. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1) shown in the collage in the previous scene, who also happens to be person #5 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/).] We see person (#1) [there is no visible indication that the person (#1) has any disability] reading a longer article. [This scene is similar to scene 6 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/) but focusing more on the person rather than on the tools.] The person (#1) looks focused and concentrated while reading. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Similarly, some people might process numbers and maths differently, and might experience difficulties reading and typing in things like credit card, telephone, and social security numbers. | @@@ 2:numbers/Luis |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might simply have difficulties remembering things like home, billing, and shipping addresses. | @@@ 3:memory/Yun |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might have difficulty focusing for long periods of time and might be easily distracted; for example, by pop-up windows and by automatically playing sounds and animations. | @@@ 4:ADHD/Preety |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Web browsers and apps can provide lots of support; for example, by providing options to store previous entries and automatically fill form fields, or by providing options to avoid pop-up windows and animations. Websites and apps need to be programmed and designed to support such settings; for example, to label form fields. | @@@ continued |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people with cognitive and learning disabilities might affect only some functions and not others. For example, some people on the autism spectrum can carry out complex tasks such as data entry while experiencing barriers with verbal communication. | @@@ 5:autism/Ian |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, some people with disabilities like cerebral palsy might experience difficulties with physical movement without it affecting their intelligence. | @@@ 6:CP/headstick |
| 9 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps that are predictable and consistent and typically easier to use. For example, some people might experience difficulty orienting themselves to a new layout and visual design, or with learning the new keystrokes they need to use for interacting with the new design. | @@@ continued |
| 10 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person's setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
