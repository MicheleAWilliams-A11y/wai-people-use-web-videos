| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Cognitive and learning disabilities is an umbrella term for a large spectrum of differences and disabilities. They affect how people store, retrieve, or use information, and many do not affect overall intelligence. | We see a collage of sux people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, many people have different degrees of dyslexia, which impacts the perception of letters and words. Sometimes letters and words can appear out of order, which makes reading harder. Some change the font type, text size, colors, and the spacing between letters, sentences, and paragraphs, to make text easier to read. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1) shown in the collage in the previous scene, who also happens to be person #5 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/).] We see person (#1) [there is no visible indication that the person (#1) has any disability] reading a longer article. [This scene is similar to scene 6 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/) but focusing more on the person rather than on the tools.] The person (#1) looks focused and concentrated while reading. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Similarly, some people might process numbers and maths differently, and might experience difficulties reading and typing in things like credit card, telephone, and social security numbers. | [New scene; switch to person (#2/Luis) who will be featured in a separate video (see [Luis' story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-five/)).] We see person (#2/Luis) holding a credit card and looking back and forth between the card and the screen while typing in the number with some difficulty. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might simply have difficulties remembering things like home, billing, and shipping addresses. | [New scene; switch to person (#3/Yun) who will be featured in a separate video (see [Yun's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-nine/)).] We see person (#3/Yun) typing in a shipping address in a longer form with lots of details (street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...). We see person (#3/Yun) typing slowly and double-checking entries while completing the form. The activity looks a little strenuous. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might have difficulty focusing for long periods of time and might be easily distracted; for example, by pop-up windows and by automatically playing sounds and animations. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Preety) who will be featured in a separate video (see [Preety's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-eight/)).] We see person (#4/Preety) navigating to a web page and starting to read, only to get interrupted by a sudden pop-up window (e.g. advertisement) that appears; person (#4/Preety) appears frustrated by the unwanted distraction. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Web browsers and apps can provide lots of support; for example, by providing options to store previous entries and automatically fill form fields, or by providing options to avoid pop-up windows and animations. Websites and apps need to be programmed and designed to support such settings; for example, to label form fields. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#4/Preety) turn on pop-up blocking in the browser settings and continue to read the article without further distraction. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people with cognitive and learning disabilities might affect only some functions and not others. For example, some people on the autism spectrum can carry out complex tasks such as data entry while experiencing barriers with verbal communication. | [New scene; switch to person (#5/Ian) who will be featured in a separate video (see [Ian's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-two/)).] We see person (#5/Ian) in a work environment (e.g. office space) carrying out data entry work on the computer. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, some people with disabilities such as cerebral palsy might experience difficulties with physical movement without it affecting their intelligence. | [New scene] We see person (#6) using a headstick (possibly with celebral palsy or similar). We see person (#6) typing on a keyboard using the headstick. |
| 9 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps that are predictable and consistent and typically easier to use. For example, some people might experience difficulty orienting themselves to a new layout and visual design, or with learning the new keystrokes they need to use for interacting with the new design. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#6) using the arrow buttons to move the focus indicator on one web page, then navigate to another web page on the same website with completely different layout and visual design. The arrow keys do not work on this new web page, and it takes person (#6) some time to realize that different behavior. Person (#6) continues by using the Tab-key; we do not see the details of that aspect, only that person (#6) needs a little time to re-orient and adapt to the new keyboard behavior. |
| 10 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the six protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person's setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
