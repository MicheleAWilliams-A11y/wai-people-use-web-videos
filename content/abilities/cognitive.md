## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Cognitive and learning disabilities is an umbrella term for a large spectrum of differences and disabilities that affect how people store, retrieve, or use information. Many of these disabilities do not affect overall intelligence. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, many people have different degrees of dyslexia, which impacts the perception of letters and words. Sometimes letters and words can appear out of order, which makes reading harder. Being able to change the font type, text size, colors, and the spacing between letters, sentences, and paragraphs on websites and apps makes text easier to read. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1) shown in the collage in the previous scene, who also happens to be person #5 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/).] We see person (#1) [there is no visible indication that the person (#1) has any disability] reading a longer article. [This scene is similar to scene 6 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/) but focusing more on the person rather than on the tools.] The person (#1) looks focused and concentrated while reading. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Similarly, some people process numbers and maths differently, or experience difficulties reading and typing in things like credit card, telephone, and social security numbers. | [New scene; switch to person (#2/Luis) who is featured in a separate video (see [Luis' script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/luis/)).] We see person (#2/Luis) holding a credit card and looking back and forth between the card and the screen while typing in the number with some difficulty. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might simply have difficulties remembering things like home, billing, and shipping addresses. Many browsers can store previous entries when websites and apps use proper code to labels the entry fields. | [New scene; switch to person (#3/Yun) who is featured in a separate video (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see person (#3/Yun) typing in a shipping address in a longer form with lots of details (street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...). We see person (#3/Yun) typing slowly and double-checking entries while completing the form. The activity looks a little strenuous. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might have difficulty focusing for long periods of time and might be easily distracted by pop-up windows and by automatically playing sounds and animations on websites and apps, which is why these should be avoided. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Preety) who is featured in a separate video (see [Preety's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/preety/)).] We see person (#4/Preety) navigating to a web page and starting to read, only to get interrupted by a sudden pop-up window (e.g. advertisement) that appears; person (#4/Preety) appears frustrated by the unwanted distraction. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people experience difficulty orienting themselves to a new layout and visual design, or with learning the new keystrokes needed to interact with the new design. Websites and apps that are designed to be consistent and predictable are typically easier to use. | [New scene; switch to person (#5/Ian) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ian's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ian/)).] We see the person (#5/Ian) using a shortcut key to initiate a menu item on one web page, then navigate to another web page on the same website with completely different layout and visual design. The shortcut key doesn't work on this new web page, and it takes person (#5/Ian) some time to realize that different behavior. Person (#5/Ian) continues by manually tabbing around the new menu [we do not see the details of that aspect, only that person (#5/Ian) needs a little time to re-orient and adapt to the new keyboard behavior]. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person's setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
