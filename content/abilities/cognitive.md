## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; cognitive and learning disabilities | [Front plate.] box with the text "Cognitive and Learning Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Cognitive and learning disabilities affect how people process and remember information. It is an umbrella term for a broad range of differences and disabilities, and many of them do not affect overall intelligence. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, many people have varying degrees of dyslexia. Dyslexia affects the ability to recognize and sound out written words, which impacts the spelling and reading comprehension. Websites and apps that allow adjusting the text size, style, colors, and the spacing between letters, sentences, and paragraphs make it easier for people to read the content. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#13) shown in the collage in the previous scene; there is no visible indication that the person (#13) has any disability.] We see the person (#13) changing the settings in a dialog window (e.g. of a browser plug-in) to adjust the font type, size, and spacing before the person (#13) starts a focused reading session. [This scene is similar to scene 6 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/) but focusing more on the person (#13) rather than on the tools.] The person (#13) looks focused and concentrated while reading. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Similarly, some people have varying degress of dyscalculia. Dyscalculia affects the ability to process and work with numbers and mathematical expressions. Websites and apps with options to store and insert long numbers, like credit card, telephone, and social security numbers, make it easier for people to fill out forms. | [New scene; switch to person (#5/Luis) who is featured in a separate video (see [Luis' script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/luis/)).] We see person (#5/Luis) holding a credit card and looking back and forth between the card and the mobile phone screen while typing in the number with some difficulty. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might have varying degrees of short term memory. Reduced short term memory affects remembering things, like where people are in a shopping and checkout process, especially in stress situations. Websites and apps with clear navigation and layout, prominent and unique page titles, and distinct instructions and cues, make it easier for people to remember where they are in the content. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see person (#9/Yun) typing in a shipping address in a longer form with lots of details (street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...). We see that the form has a clear layout with good instructions for each form input (e.g. date format), as well as a distinct visual indicator for the currently active input field. We see the person (#9/Yun) using functionality of the browser to auto-complete stored information (e.g. street name of phone number). We also see that the page itself has clear indications of the process (e.g. "Step 3 of 4" and illustrative horizontal progress indicator), as well as distinct back and next buttons (with different colors and with arrows in addition to text) at the top and bottom of the page. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Or, people might have varying degress of ADHD -- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADHD affects the ability to focus for longer periods of time, and it affects the impact of distraction. In addition to breaking up longer passages of text and using headings to organize the content, websites and apps without pop-up windows and automatically playing sounds make it easier for people to focus and follow the content. | [New scene; switch to person (#8/Preety) who is featured in a separate video (see [Preety's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/preety/)).] We see person (#8/Preety) navigating to a web page and starting to read, only to get interrupted by a sudden pop-up window (e.g. advertisement) that appears; person (#8/Preety) appears frustrated by the unwanted distraction. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Also, some people experience difficulty orienting themselves in layouts and visual designs that are new to them, and with learning the keystrokes or gestures needed for interaction. Websites and apps with consistent and predictable designs and with clear and distinct instructions make it easier for people to orient themselves and complete tasks. | [New scene; switch to person (#2/Ian) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ian's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ian/)).] We see the person (#2/Ian) navigating a website where the navigation bar keeps moving on each page (e.g. once on the left, then the top, then with breadcrumbs or without, then with or without a secondary navigation bar etc.). We recognize that it is the same website due to the header, colors, and other visual aspects but the layout of each page looks significantly different and confusing. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person's setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
