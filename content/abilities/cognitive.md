## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; cognitive and learning disabilities. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Cognitive and Learning Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Cognitive and learning disabilities affect how people process, understand, and remember information. They cover a wide range of cognitive differences and disabilities, and many of them do not affect overall intelligence. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, many people have varying degrees of dyslexia. Dyslexia affects the ability to recognize and sound out written words, which impacts spelling and reading comprehension. Websites and apps with sufficient white space and headings to separate the content make it easier for people to read. Clear navigation with distinct section headers also make it easier for people to navigate through the content. Websites and apps also need to work with reading tools, including tools that adjust how the text is presented, read the text aloud, and help with spelling and grammar. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#13) shown in the collage in the previous scene; there is no visible indication that the person (#13) has any disability.] We see the person (#13) changing the settings in a dialog window (e.g. of a browser plug-in) to adjust the font type, size, and spacing before the person (#13) starts a focused reading session. [This scene is similar to scene 6 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/) but focusing more on the person (#13) rather than on the tools.] The person (#13) looks focused and concentrated while reading. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Similarly, some people have varying degrees of dyscalculia. Dyscalculia affects the ability to process and work with numbers and mathematical concepts. Websites and apps that provide alternatives to mathematical abstractions, are easier to use for people with dyscalculia. This could include showing a progress bar instead of or in addition to showing a percentage. Websites and apps can also provide visual aids and text descriptions for things like schedules and temperatures. | [New scene; switch to person (#8/Preety) who is featured in a separate video (see [Preety's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/preety/)).] We see the person (#8/Preety) completing a form (single-page or multi-page). We see a prominent progress indicator showing a percentage (completion rate). We focus more clsoely and also see a progres bar, meter, or other visual indicator in addition to the number. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People have varying degrees of memory abilities, including short-term and working memory. Reduced short-term memory affects the ability to remember new things, such as passwords, or where in a process someone might be, especially in stressful situations. Websites and apps with clear navigation and layout, prominent and unique page titles, and distinct instructions and cues can make it easier for people to remember where they are in the content. Websites and apps can also help people remember information they have previously added, such as addresses and telephone numbers. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see person (#9/Yun) typing in a shipping address in a longer form with lots of details (street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...). We see that the form has a clear layout with good instructions for each form input (e.g. date format), as well as a distinct visual indicator for the currently active input field. We see the person (#9/Yun) using functionality of the browser to auto-complete stored information (e.g. street name of phone number). We also see that the page itself has clear indications of the process (e.g. "Step 3 of 4" and illustrative horizontal progress indicator), as well as distinct back and next buttons (with different colors and with arrows in addition to text) at the top and bottom of the page. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People might have different levels of attention and focus. This includes people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), brain trauma, age-related forgetfulness, and dementia. These cognitive differences affect the ability to focus and to resume a task after the user is distracted. In addition to breaking up longer passages of text and using headings, websites and apps without pop-up windows and automatically playing videos, sounds, or animations make it easier for people to focus and follow the content. | [New scene; switch to person (#5/Luis) who is featured in a separate video (see [Luis' script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/luis/)).] We see person (#5/Luis) navigating to a web page and starting to read, only to get interrupted by a sudden pop-up window (e.g. advertisement) that appears; person (#8/Luis) appears frustrated by the unwanted distraction. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people experience difficulty orienting themselves in layouts and visual designs that are new to them. It may also be difficult for them to learn new keystrokes or gestures needed for interaction. Websites and apps with familiar, consistent, and predictable designs and with clear and distinct instructions make it easier for people to know where they are and complete tasks. | [New scene; switch to person (#2/Ian) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ian's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ian/)).] We see the person (#2/Ian) navigating a website where the navigation bar keeps moving on each page (e.g. once on the left, then the top, then with breadcrumbs or without, then with or without a secondary navigation bar etc.). We recognize that it is the same website due to the header, colors, and other visual aspects but the layout of each page looks significantly different and confusing. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] These are ways to make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the five protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
