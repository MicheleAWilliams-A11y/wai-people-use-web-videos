## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Auditory disabilities can have many forms. They can involve one or both ears to varying degrees. | We see a group of people standing and talking to each other (like in a cocktail party / reception setting). |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people can hear sounds but not sufficiently to understand all speech; they are commonly referred to as “hard of hearing”. | [Continuation from previous scene.] Zoom onto one person (#1) in the group and we realize they are having difficulty understanding what others are saying. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Cochlear implants and other hearing aids often don't fully compensate hearing loss, especially when there is background noise. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We realize that this person (#1) has a cochlear implant and that it is a loud environment.|
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with auditory disabilities require captions as an alternative to the audio. | [New scene.] We see someone (#2) watching a video and turning on the captions. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | This includes audio in videos, podcasts and other audio recordings, online meetings and webinars, and music. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the same person (#2) in an online meeting with captions on as well. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Many people who use captions also require options to adjust the text size and colors to make the captions more readable. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#2) adjust the text size and colors of the captions. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | While automatic captions are gradually improving, they are generally too inaccurate for reliable use. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#2) switch to another video, and turn on automatic captions for that second video. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They often don't recognize names, specialized terms, and who is talking. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see obviously inaccurate captions, and the person (#2) looking confused / frustrated. |
| 9 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are hard of hearing often require high-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise. | [New scene.] We see a person (#3) watching a video and adjusting their hearing aid. |
| 10 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They often also require volume controls for the audio playing, so that they can turn it up independently of other sounds, such as notification sounds. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#3) adjust the volume of the video independently from other audio (we see a sound mixer widget with multiple volume sliders, and they adjust one of the volume sliders on the mixer). |
| 11 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears are commonly referred to as “deaf”. | [New scene.] We see someone (#4) in an online meeting with sign language interpreters on the call. |
| 12 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For many people who are deaf, sign language is the primary language for communication. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the sign language interpreters sign to the person (#4), and the person (#4) nodding/signing/gesturing back to signal acknowledgment to the interpreters. |
| 13 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They often require high-quality video transmissions for communicating in sign language. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#4) maximize the window of the sign language interpreter. |
| 14 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They might not read as fluently because spoken and written language has a different grammar and vocabulary than sign language. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#4) open an electronic document sent in the online meeting app; the document has large blocks of text (walls of text) without any structuring, and the person (#4) has difficulty reading it. |
| 15 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Other people who are deaf might not know sign language, especially when they acquire deafness later in life. | [New scene.] We see an older person (#5) starting a video and switching on captions. |
| 16 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They require captions, like people who are hard of hearing require. | [Continuation from previous scene.] The person (#5) looks satisfied (maybe watching their favorite show). |
| 17 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people are deaf-blind; they require transcripts as an alternative to both audio and visual content. | [New scene.] We see someone (#6) selecting "see transcript" link beside a video. |
| 18 | 0:00 - 0:00 | The transcripts include the captions as well as descriptions of the visual content in text format. | [Continuation from previous scene.] Zoom into the transcript, to show that there are captions as well as descriptions of the visual content (we can't really read all the text but the formatting makes it clear that there is text for the audio and visual content). |
| 19 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All these people have one thing in common: your design can include or exclude them. | [New scene.] We see a collage of all protagonists from the previous scenes (#1-6) happily using computer technologies (continuations from their respective scenes). |
