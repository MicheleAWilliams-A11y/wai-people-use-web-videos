## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Auditory disabilities include mild and moderate forms of hearing loss in one or both ears. | @@@ |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with such hearing disabilities are commonly referred to as “hard of hearing”. | @@@ |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Auditory disabilities also includes substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears. | @@@ |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | This is commonly referred to as “deafness”. | @@@ |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. | Someone in a crowd having difficulty understanding what others are saying. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | This can include people using hearing aids. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see that this person has a hearing aid.|
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People with auditory disabilities require captions as an alternative to audio content. | [New scene.] We see someone watching a video and turning on the captions. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | This includes audio in videos, podcasts and other audio recordings, online meetings and webinars, and music. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the same person in an online meeting with captions on as well. |
| 9 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Many people who use captions also need to be able to adjust their text size and colors to make them more readable. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person adjust the text size and colors of the captions. |
| 10 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are deaf-blind require transcripts as an alternative to audio and visual content. | [New scene.] We see someone selecting "see transcript" link beside a video. |
| 11 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are hard of hearing often need high-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise. | [New scene.] We see a person watching a video and adjusting their hearing aid. |
| 12 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They often also need volume controls for the audio content, to turn that up independently of other audio. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person adjust the volume of the video (independently from other audio). |
| 13 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are deaf sometimes need sign language interpretation as an alternative to audio content. | [New scene.] We see someone in an online meeting with sign language interpreters on the call. |
| 14 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For many people who are deaf, sign language is the primary language. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person sign back to the interpreters. |
| 15 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They might not read as fluently because writing has a different grammar and vocabulary. | [Continuation from previous scene.] @@@ |
| 16 | 0:00 - 0:00 | They often need high-quality video transmissions for communicating in sign language. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person maximize the window of the sign language interpreter. |
| 17 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people who are deaf might not know sign language, especially when they acquire their disability later in life. | [New scene.] @@@ |
| 18 | 0:00 - 0:00 | @@@ | @@@ |
| 19 | 0:00 - 0:00 | @@@ | @@@ |
