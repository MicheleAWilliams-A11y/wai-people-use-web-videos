## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Many types of disabilities involve limited hand movement or control, or none at all. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, some people might not be able to type fast or for longer periods of time because of reduced muscle strength in the hand, muscle fatigue, or repetitve strain injury (RSI). | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#1) shown in the collage in the previous scene.] We see person (#1) [there is no visible indication that the person (#1) has any disability] typing noticeably more slowly and with less movement of the arms and hands. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people might not be able to use their hands to type, for example due to paralysis, spasms, amputation, or different body forms, and might be using specialized keyboards or hardware tools to type. An example of a tool to help typing is a mouthstick. People use the stick they hold in their mouth to type on a keyboard. | [New scene; switch to another person (#2) from the initial collage in the first scene] We see a person (#2) using a mouthstick to type on a regular keyboard. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps need to be programmed and designed for keyboard support, so that all functionality, can be carried out through the keyboard alone. They also need to provide sufficient time for people to type and complete tasks, provide clear instructions to help users complete forms and processes, and help users identify and correct mistakes. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We swing over from the person (#2) to the computer screen, and realize that the person (#2) is completing a form. We scan over the content on the screen with clear instructions (e.g. date format) and clear error messages appearing as the narration mentions these aspects. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people might not be able to use the mouse and other pointing devices accurately, for long periods of time, or at all. For example, tremors and other involuntary movement can make it difficult for people to click on small areas such as checkboxes and radio buttons. | [New scene; switch to person (#3/Yun) who will be featured in a separate video too (see [Yun's story page](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/user-stories-nine/)).] We see a person (#3/Yun) reading a website and using larger text size. We see person (#3/Yun) having difficulty using the mouse to click on a link in the navigation menu due to tremors in the hand. The person (#3/Yun) looks concentrated and focused while selecting the link. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Yet some people might rely solely on using pointing devices such as a mouse, joystick, trackball, steering wheel, or touch screen to type. For example, by using an eye-tracking system to type on an on-screen keyboard. The system detects eye movement to move the mouse pointer, and detects eye blinks to initiate mouse clicks. | [New scene.] We see a person (#4) using an eye-tracking system. We see the person (#4) moving their eyes and blinking while we swing over from the person to the computer screen to see them typing on an on-screen keyboard using their eye movement. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people might not be using a keyboard nor a pointing device to type, and rely on speech input instead. While speech input uses the keyboard interface in the background, websites and apps need to be programmed and designed to support speech input. For example, so that the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed to the user. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist speak a command to the computer, like “click send email”.] | [New scene.] We see a person (#5) using a headset/microphone to dictate words in an email. We do not hear what the person (#5) is saying at first but we see their mouth moving and words appearing in the email. We see the person (#5) continuing with the "send email" command, and see their mouth move while we hear these words, and we understand that the person was dictating the email all along. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person's setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
