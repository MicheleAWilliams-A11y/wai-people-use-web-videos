## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; pysical disabilities. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Physical Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Physical disabilities affect the motor abilities of people, including weakness and limitations of muscular control, limitations of sensation, joint disorders, pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, some people do not use a mouse, touch screen, or other pointing devices, and need to carry out all functionality through the keyboard alone. Websites and apps that allow more time for typing support people who need more time and cannot type fast or for longer periods of time. For example, due to reduced muscle strength in the hand; muscle fatigue; repetitve strain injury, or simply difficulty typing. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#14) shown in the collage in the previous scene.] We see the person (#14) using a headstick (possibly with celebral palsy or similar) to type on a regular keyboard. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people use pointing devices only. For example, a mouse, joystick, trackball, or touch screen to click links and buttons and to type on on-screen keyboards. Websites and apps with large click areas, such as checkboxes and radio buttons, are easier to use for people with lower dexterity, including tremors and other involuntary movement. Also, websites and apps that work in both landscape and portrait modes are easier to use for people who cannot change the orientation of their devices; for example, because it is fixed to their wheelchair.| [New scene.] We see the person (#15) using a touch screen mounted to their wheelchair and having difficulty clicking on small form controls (e.g. radio buttons). |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people use both specialized keyboards and pointing devices. For example, keyboards with larger keys, more space between the keys, or a different ergonomic design; or pointing devices like a joystick with an enlarged lever. Websites and apps that support concurrent input modalities are more flexible for people with different setups. | [New scene; switch to person (#1/Alan) who is featured in a separate video (see [Alan's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/)).] We see the person (#1/Alan) switching betweeen typing on a specialized keyboard with larger keys and more space between the keys and specialized joystick with enlarged lever. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Other people do not use keyboard or pointing devices at all, and use speech input instead. While speech input uses the keyboard interface in the background, websites and apps that are programmed and designed with particular consideration for speech input are more effective. For example, when the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed visually, people using speech input know the name they need to say to click that button. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist speak a command to the computer, like "click send email".] | [New scene.] We see the person (#16) with no visible disability using a headset/microphone to dictate words in an email. We do not hear what the person (#16) is saying at first but we see their mouth moving and words appearing in the email. We see the person (#16) continuing with the "send email" command, and see their mouth move while we hear these words, and we understand that the person was dictating the email all along. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Regardless of input modality, websites and apps that provide sufficient time to type and to complete tasks; clear instructions to complete forms and processes effectively; and options to find and correct mistakes in their input, make it easier for people with physical disabilities to interact with them. Websites and apps also need to ensure that the focus indicator of the browser remains visible, and provide ways to skip over content repeated on every page, such as headings and navigation bars. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see a person (#9/Yun) navigating a well-structured. We see the person (#9/Yun) typing and clicking more slowly and with some difficulty, and being helped by the distinctive visible focus reminding him of the input field that is currently active. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] These are ways to make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the five protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |
