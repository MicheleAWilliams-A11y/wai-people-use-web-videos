## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; physical disabilities. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Physical Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Physical disabilities affect how people move, including inability to move, limited mobility and lack of coordination, tremors and involuntary movement, pain that impedes movement, as well as missing and non-typical limbs. | We see a collage of four people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people with physical disabilities do not use a mouse, touch screen, or other pointing devices because they require more motor control and dexterity for moving and clicking. Instead, they might use keyboards, which are more stable. This includes specialized keyboards with larger keys, more space between the keys, or a different ergonomic design. Some people use tools such as a mouthstick or headstick to type. Websites and apps that make all functionality available with keyboard commands only are easier to use for people with physical disabilities. This includes not breaking the default functionality in web browsers and operating systems, that use the Tab key to move around clickable items in the content, use the Enter key for selecting items, and show a rectangular box known as focus indicator around the currently active item so that people can see which item is currently active. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#14) shown in the collage in the previous scene.] We see the person (#14) using a headstick (possibly with cerebral palsy or similar) to type on a regular keyboard. We see the person (#14) using the Tab and Enter keys on a form, and the focus indicator move accordingly as the person (#14) navigates to a text box and starts typing (e.g. an email message). We hear the narration at the same time as the visuals. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who use a mouse might still have difficulty with fine motor control. For example, tremors, non-typical joints, pain, or fatigue can prevent people from being able to select small targets, such as small links, buttons, and controls. Websites and apps with large click areas around checkboxes, radio buttons, and other controls, are easier to use for people with limited mobility and reduced dexterity. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see the person (#9/Yun), who has hand tremors that make it difficult to click on small links and form controls (e.g. radio buttons). |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Other people might not use keyboard or pointing devices at all, and use speech input instead. While speech input uses the keyboard interface in the background, websites and apps that are programmed and designed with particular consideration for speech input are more effective. For example, when the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed visually, people using speech input know the name they need to say to click that button. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist speak a command to the computer, like "click send email".] | [New scene; switch to person (#1/Alan) who is featured in a separate video (see [Alan's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/)).] We see the person (#1/Alan) dictating words in an email. We do not hear what the person (#1/Alan) is saying at first but we see their mouth moving and words appearing in the email. We see the person (#1/Alan) continuing with the "send email" command, and see their mouth move while we hear these words, and we understand that the person was dictating the email all along. [This scene is similar scene in 7 in the [Alan script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/) and to scene 6 in the [Input script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/input/).] |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Regardless of the input device used, websites and apps that provide sufficient time to type and to complete tasks are easier to use for people with physical disabilities because it might take people longer to navigate and type, and to correct typing mistakes. Providing clear headings and instructions helps people to understand the tasks and reduces the time needed to complete them. This includes instructions for forms and functionality, as well as on error messages and dialogs. Also, websites and apps that work in both portrait and landscape orientation are easier to use for people who have their devices mounted to their wheelchair, desk, or bed. | [New scene.] We see the person (#15) using a touch screen mounted to their wheelchair. We see the person (#15) tapping the touchscreen with their knuckles, mouthstick, eye tracking, or similar [the protagonist might have limited control or involuntary movement]. We see the person (#15) is entering data in an app, first reading the instructions that appear (eg. "Please enter your email address") then typing the information (eg. with an on-screen keyboard). |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] These are ways to make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the four protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. [Note: some protagonists might be signing rather than speaking, or speaking with the help of software or hardware tools.] |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
