## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Physical disabilities, sometimes called "motor disabilities", are disabilities that include weakness and limitations of muscular control, limitations of sensation, joint disorders, pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, some people cannot use a mouse, touch screen, or other pointing devices, and need to carry out all functionality through the keyboard alone. Many need more time, and cannot type fast or for longer periods of time because: typing is difficult; reduced muscle strength in the hand; muscle fatigue; or repetitve strain injury (RSI). | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#14) shown in the collage in the previous scene.] We see the person (#14) using a headstick (possibly with celebral palsy or similar) to type on a regular keyboard. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people use pointing devices only; for example, a mouse, joystick, trackball, or touch screen to click links and buttons and to type on on-screen keyboards. Many people have difficulty clicking on small areas such as checkboxes and radio buttons; for example, due to tremors and other involuntary movement. Also, websites and apps need to work in both landscape and portrait modes because some people cannot change the setup of their devices.| [New scene.] We see the person (#15) using a touch screen mounted to their wheelchair and having difficulty clicking on small form controls (eg. radio buttons). |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people use both -- specialized keyboards, for example keyboards with larger keys, more space between the keys, or in many different ergnomic designs, or pointing devices, for example joystick with enlarged lever -- so that websites and apps need to support concurrent input devices. | [New scene; switch to person (#1/Alan) who is featured in a separate video (see [Alan's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/alan/)).] We see the person (#1/Alan) switching betweeen typing on a specialized keyboard with larger keys and more space between the keys and specialized joystick with enlarged lever. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Other people do not use keyboard or pointing devices at all, and use speech input instead. While speech input uses the keyboard interface in the background, websites and apps need to be programmed and designed with particular considerations. For example, so that the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed to the user. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist speak a command to the computer, like "click send email".] | [New scene.] We see the person (#16) with no visible disability using a headset/microphone to dictate words in an email. We do not hear what the person (#16) is saying at first but we see their mouth moving and words appearing in the email. We see the person (#16) continuing with the "send email" command, and see their mouth move while we hear these words, and we understand that the person was dictating the email all along. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Regardless of input modality, people with physical disabilities need sufficient time to type and to complete tasks; clear instructions to complete forms and processes effectively; and options to find and correct mistakes in their input. Websites and apps also need to ensure that the focus indicator of the browser remains visible, and provide ways to skip over content repeated on every page, such as headings and navigation bars. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see a person (#9/Yun) navigating a well-structured. We see the person (#9/Yun) typing and clicking more slowly and with some difficulty, and being helped by the distinctive visible focus reminding him of the input field that is currently active. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person's setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
