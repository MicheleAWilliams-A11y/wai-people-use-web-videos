## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; visual disabilities. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Visual Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Visual disabilities affect how people see, including partial vision in one or both eyes, not seeing at all, or seeing in a range of different ways including colors and brightness. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are blind use assistive technology on computers and mobile phones called screen readers. These software tools can read the information on the screen out loud, or they can present it in Braille. Screen readers can process websites and apps with correctly coded headings, lists, links, button, and other structures much better. Websites and apps also need to work with the keyboard, and have text alternatives for images [brief pause to listen to a short slice of screen reader (through the headphones) at moderately high speed while the video is being shown in the visuals]. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#3/Ilya) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ilya's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/)).] We see the person (#3/Ilya) using a screen reader and headphones. We scan over the content on the screen with images the narration mentions these aspects. [This scene is similar to scene in 3 in the [Perception script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/perception/) and to scene 2 in the [Ilya script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/).] |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | However, most people with visual disabilities are not blind but have some form of low vision. This means that people can partially see, just not clearly or within the full range of vision. Some people with low vision use screen magnification software as a digital magnifying glass to enlarge everything on the screen. This includes images, text, and the mouse pointer. With this, people only see small parts of the screen at a time, so they rely on visual cues and consistent design in  websites and apps to stay oriented and navigate effectively. | [New scene; switch to another person (#7/Noor) who is featured in a separate video (see [Noor's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/noor/)).] We see the person (#7/Noor) using screen magnification software, and using visual cues to orient herself around a web page. [This scene is similar to scene 3 in the [Navigation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/navigation/).] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Others with low vision might not use the same assistive technology. They might adjust properties in the web browser or operating system, such as increasing the default text size, to better see the text. Websites and apps that are programmed and designed to adapt to the properties set by users, such as different text sizes, font type, and line spacing, allow people to use the content without the text overlapping, getting cropped, or requiring them to scroll both vertically and horizontally. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video too (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see the person (#9/Yun) using a widget on the web browser to increase the text size, and we see the website starts to crumble as he increases the text size to read it (text starts overlapping, getting cropped, getting lost, horizontal scroll bars appearing, ...). [This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/).] |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For some people, making text smaller is easier to see. Someone with tunnel vision may see very clearly, just not in a wide range of view. Websites and apps that can adapt to smaller text sizes make it easier for people with tunnel vision to see more of the screen at one time. | [New scene.] We see the person (#21) using hand-held non-digital assistive technology (e.g. monoculars or specialized glasses). We see the person (#21) using the same widget on the web browser from the previous scene to reduce the text size, and we see the website start to crumble as the text size is reduced (things start to re-order and move around the screen, confusing white spaces start to appear, ...). |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who cannot distinguish certain colors are often called "color blind". Websites and apps that avoid text with low contrast, such as light gray text on a white background, are easier to use for people who are color blind. Itâ€™s also important that websites and apps don't use only color to communicate information, but do use text and symbols in addition to color, such as an asterisk to indicate required input fields. Some people are sensitive to bright light, so it's important that websites and apps can adapt to the color schemes that people might set in their browsers and operating systems. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Lee) who is featured in a separate video too (see [Lee's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/lee/)).] We see a person (#4/Lee) [there is no visible indication that the person (#4/Lee) has any disability] using the browser settings to adjust the forground and background colors to high-contrast, similar to the colors that the person (#7/Noor) from scene 4 has set in the screen magnification. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] These are ways to make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the five protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. [Note: some protagonists might be signing rather than speaking, or speaking with the help of software or hardware tools.] |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
