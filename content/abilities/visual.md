Video script for [Visual](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers-visual/) from the page [Diverse Abilities and Barriers](https://deploy-preview-113--wai-people-use-web.netlify.app/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/) (in the [2020 Update](https://github.com/w3c/wai-people-use-web/wiki/Persona-development) version).

## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Visual disabilities includes people who have low vision, do not see, or see differently. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are blind use assistive technology called screen readers. These software tools present information on the screen in audio to hear, or in braille on a refreshable braille display. For screen readers to work, content needs to be properly programmed and designed. For example, images need to have text alternatives, so that screen readers can convey the text alternatives as audio or to braille. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#3/Ilya) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ilya's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/)).] We see person (#3/Ilya) using a screen reader, headphones, and a refreshable braille display. We scan over the content on the screen with images the narration mentions these aspects. [This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Navigation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/navigation/).] |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are blind use the keyboard for navigating, typing, and launching all functionality. For example, entering a date must be be carried out through the keyboard alone without needing to use a mouse or touch screen. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#3/Ilya) using the keyboard only (no mouse on the desk) to navigate through form and complete the fields / select the options. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people with low vision use screen magnification software as a digital magnifying glass. These software tools enlarge everything on the screen, including images, text, and the mouse pointer as well. People only see small parts of the screen at a time, and rely on visual cues and consistent design to orient themselves and navigate through websites and apps. | [New scene; switch to another person (#7/Noor) who is featured in a separate video (see [Noor's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/noor/)).] We see the person (#7/Noor) using screen magnification software, and using visual cues to orient herself around a web page. [This scene is similar to scene 3 in the [Navigation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/navigation/).] |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps also need to be programmed and designed to adapt to different text sizes and line spacing without the text overlapping, getting cropped, or creating difficult scrolling. For example, other people with low vision do not use any assistive technology. They increase the text size or adjust other properties of the text, such as the font type and line spacing. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video too (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see the person (#9/Yun) using a widget on the web browser to increase the text size, and we see the website starts to crumble as he increases the text size to read it (text starts overlapping, getting cropped, getting lost, horizontal scroll bars appearing, ...). [This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/).] |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | At the same time, some people with low vision reduce the text size. For example, someone with tunnel vision might only see through a narrow field of vision. Yet, they might see so well in that field of vision that they reduce the text size to read more of the text at a time. | [New scene.] We see the person (#21) using hand-held non-digital assistive technology (e.g. monoculars or specialized glasses). We see the person (#21) using the same widget on the web browser from the previous scene to reduce the text size, and we see the website start to crumble as the text size is reduced (things start to re-order and move around the screen, confusing white spaces start to appear, ...). |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Many people see colors differently, which is commonly referred to as color blind. People who are color blind might not have reduced visual acuity. Websites and apps need to allow readers to change the colors; for example, through browser settings. They also cannot use colors alone to communicate information; for example, mandatory and optional form fields need to be identifiable by text not by color only. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Lee) who is featured in a separate video too (see [Lee's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/lee/)).] We see a person (#4/Lee) [there is no visible indication that the person (#4/Lee) has any disability] using the browser settings to adjust the forground and background colors to high-contrast, similar to the colors that the person (#7/Noor) from scene 4 has set in the screen magnification. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see a collage of the five protagonists from the previous scenes [in the same style and continuing the first scene] happily using computer technologies [each person's setting is a continuation of their respective scenes]. |
