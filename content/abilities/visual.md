## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; visual disabilities. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Visual Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Visual disabilities affect how people see, including seeing less in one or both eyes, not seeing, and seeing in a range of different ways. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | People who are blind use assistive technology on computers and mobile phones called screen readers. These software tools can read the information on the screen out loud, or they can present the information in Braille using a device called a refreshable Braille display. Websites and apps with correctly coded headings, lists, links, button, and other structures can be better processed by screen readers. Websites and apps also need to work with keyboard, and have text alternatives for images, which are presented instead of the image [brief pause to listen to a short slice of screen reader at moderately high speed while the video is being shown in the visuals]. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#3/Ilya) who is featured in a separate video (see [Ilya's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/ilya/)).] We see the person (#3/Ilya) using a screen reader, headphones, and a refreshable braille display. We scan over the content on the screen with images the narration mentions these aspects. [This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Navigation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/navigation/).] |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | However, most people with visual disabilities have some form of low vision. This means that people can partially see, just not clearly or within full range of vision. Some people with low vision use screen magnification software as a digital magnifying glass, to enlarge everything on the screen. This includes images, text, and the mouse pointer. With this, people only see small parts of the screen at a time, so they rely on visual cues and consistent design in  websites and apps, to stay oriented and navigate effectively. | [New scene; switch to another person (#7/Noor) who is featured in a separate video (see [Noor's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/noor/)).] We see the person (#7/Noor) using screen magnification software, and using visual cues to orient herself around a web page. [This scene is similar to scene 3 in the [Navigation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/navigation/).] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Others with low vision might not use such assistive technology. They might adjust properties in the web browser or operating system, such as increasing the default text size, to better see the text. Websites and apps that are programmed and designed to adapt to such properties set by users, such as different text sizes, font type, and line spacing, allow people to use the content without the text overlapping, getting cropped, or requiring horizontal scrolling. | [New scene; switch to person (#9/Yun) who is featured in a separate video too (see [Yun's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/yun/)).] We see the person (#9/Yun) using a widget on the web browser to increase the text size, and we see the website starts to crumble as he increases the text size to read it (text starts overlapping, getting cropped, getting lost, horizontal scroll bars appearing, ...). [This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Presentation script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/tools/presentation/).] |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Similar to making text larger, sometimes making text smaller is easier to see. For instance, someone with tunnel vision may see very clearly, just not in a wide range of view. Websites and apps that allow making text smaller but still keep the same page layout make it easier for the person to see more of the screen at one time. | [New scene.] We see the person (#21) using hand-held non-digital assistive technology (e.g. monoculars or specialized glasses). We see the person (#21) using the same widget on the web browser from the previous scene to reduce the text size, and we see the website start to crumble as the text size is reduced (things start to re-order and move around the screen, confusing white spaces start to appear, ...). |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Finally, people with visual disabilities also includes people who see colors in a range of different ways, commonly referred to as colorblind. Often this means it can be hard for people to tell colors apart, so itâ€™s important that websites and apps do not use just color to communicate information. In addition to color, websites and apps can also use text and symbols, such as an asterisk to indicate required input fields. People who are colorblind might also adjust properties in the web browser or operating system, such as font color and style, to better distinguish text color from its background. Websites and apps also need to be programmed and designed to adapt to such properties set by users. | [New scene; switch to person (#4/Lee) who is featured in a separate video too (see [Lee's script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/lee/)).] We see a person (#4/Lee) [there is no visible indication that the person (#4/Lee) has any disability] using the browser settings to adjust the forground and background colors to high-contrast, similar to the colors that the person (#7/Noor) from scene 4 has set in the screen magnification. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] These are ways to make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the five protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |
