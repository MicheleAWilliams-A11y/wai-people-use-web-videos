## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; speech disabilities. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Speech Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Speech disabilities affect how people speaking, including not speaking and speaking in a range of different ways, such as patterns, pitches, and sounds. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For example, some people stutter, pause, or pronounce sounds differently. [brief pause to listen to the protagonist say something like "while you can understand me, speech recognition systems often don't" (the protagonist has a mild speech disability that most viewers/listeners would understand).] | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#17) shown in the collage in the previous scene.] We see the person (#17) first typing on a computer then turning to us (the viewers/camera) to speak the words we hear in the audio. We see a digital assistant nearby but dissociated from person the (#17) (e.g. on someone else's desk).  |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | While it is a common perception among many, speaking differently is not an indication of the person's intellectual capabilities. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see the person (#17) getting up and move around, and we realize the person (#17) is a researcher in a laboratory (or similar). |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people do not speak at all because they are Deaf, autistic, have injured or no vocal organs, or because of another condition. | [New scene; switch to person (#6/Martine) who is featured in a separate video (see [Martine's story page](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/martine/)).] We see the person (#6/Martine) in an online meeting and signing to communicate with others in the meeting. [This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Martine script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/martine/).] |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps that require speech input can be a barrier for some people. For example, when an online application such as a customer support systems relies on speech without providing an alternative, like chat or email. | [New scene.] We see a person (#18) [there is no visible indication that the person (#18) has any disability] using a website or app and trying to contact customer support but the only available mechanism is an online calling option. The person (#18) is looking confused / frustrated. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps that rely on automatic speech recognition can also be a barrier for people with different speech patterns. For example, "some people use software for generating speech" [we hear that part of the sentence in quotes through speech synthesis coming from a computer] and "some people use hardware for generating speech"  [we hear that part of the sentence in quotes through speech synthesis coming from an electrolarynx device], which is sometimes not recognized by automatic speech recognition. | [New scene.] We see two people (#19) and (#20), one after the other (that is, two different sub-scenes that are intertwined). [First sub-scene] We see person (#19) typing some text on a computer, then we swing over from the typing to see what the person (#19) typed while we hear the generated speech coming out of the loud speaker. [Second sub-scene] We see the person (#20) speaking to us (the viewers/camera) by holding an electrolarynx device to the throat and speaking the words we hear. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] This is how you can make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the five protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrtor speaks their line. |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
