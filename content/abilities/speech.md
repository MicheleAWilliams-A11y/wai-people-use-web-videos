## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | How people with disabilities use the web; speech disabilities. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Speech Disabilities". |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Speech disabilities affect how people speak, including not speaking, or speaking in a range of different patterns, pitches, and sounds. | We see a collage of five people going about their lives in their different settings [they are the protagonists that we will see in the coming scenes]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Some people do not speak at all. This can include people who are Deaf, autistic, have injured or no vocal organs, or have other conditions impacting physical or cognitive speech production. | [New scene; zoom into the context/setting of one of the people (#6/Martine) who is featured in a separate video (see [Martine's story page](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/martine/)).] We see the person (#6/Martine) in an online meeting and signing to communicate with others in the meeting. [This scene is similar to scene 2 in the [Martine script](https://wai-people-use-web-videos.netlify.app/people-use-web/videos/stories/martine/).] |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Unfortunately, although it's a common misperception, speaking differently is not an indication of a person's intellectual capabilities. Many people stutter, pause, or pronounce words in a range of different patterns, pitches, and utterances due to various disabilities. [Brief pause to listen to the protagonist say something like "while you might be able to understand me, automatic speech recognition systems often don't" (the protagonist has a mild speech disability that most viewers/listeners would understand).] Some people use a variety of different assistive technologies to generate speech. | [New scene; switch to person (#17).] We see the person (#17) first typing on a computer then turning to us (the viewers/camera) to speak the words we hear in the audio. We see a digital assistant nearby but dissociated from the person (#17) (e.g. on someone else's desk). After the person (#17) speaks, we see the person (#17) getting up and move around, and we realize that the person (#17) is a researcher in a laboratory (or similar). |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | "I use software for generating speech, which is often not recognized by automatic speech recognition" [we hear that part of the sentence in quotes through speech synthesis coming from a computer] | [New scene.] We see the person (#19) typing some text on a computer, then we swing over from the typing to see what the person (#19) typed while we hear the generated speech coming out of the loud speaker. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Websites and apps that require speech input can be a barrier for people with speech disabilities, especially when they rely on automatic speech recognition. Instead, websites and apps, such as customer support systems, need to provide alternatives to voice calls, like chat or email. | [New scene.] We see a person (#18) [there is no visible indication that the person (#18) has any disability] using a website or app and trying to contact customer support but the only available mechanism is an online calling option. The person (#18) is looking confused / frustrated. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Individual protagonists:] These are ways to make technology work for me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see the five protagonists from the previous scenes. They are looking into the camera as they speak their lines to the viewers [either individually or all at the same time, to be decided]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. [Note: some protagonists might be signing rather than speaking, or speaking with the help of software or hardware tools.] |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
